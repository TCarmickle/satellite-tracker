SATELLITE TRACKER
=================

A map of the satellites YOUR antenna hears, with an RTL-SDR: Iridium (1.6 GHz), ORBCOMM
(137 MHz), the ISS and amateur (ham) CubeSats on 2 m and 70 cm, and the GPS and Galileo
navigation satellites with a GPS antenna (see "SYSTEMS" and "GNSS" below). Every position and
orbit comes from what you receive - no downloaded orbit data is used for positions.

Iridium satellites send ring alerts that carry their own position; with their Doppler shifts
the tracker fits every orbit from those observations alone. Orbcomm satellites send their
position too, and GPS / Galileo satellites broadcast their own orbit. The map, list, globe and
sky plot show every system together, with a Systems filter to show just one.

Everything is in this folder: the decoders (gr-iridium, iridium-toolkit, gr-satellites,
PocketSDR), Python, and the app.
Nothing is installed on the computer except the SDR's USB driver (see "THE USB DRIVER" below).
If you got this folder from GitHub rather than the ready-made zip, it has no "python" folder
yet: see "INSTALLING FROM GITHUB" below first.


WHAT YOU NEED
-------------
- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
- An RTL-SDR that tunes to 1626 MHz. Tested with the Nooelec SMArTee XTR (E4000 tuner);
  R820T/R828D "V3/V4" dongles also reach 1626 MHz.
- An antenna for L-band (1.6 GHz) with a clear view of the sky. Even a small patch or a
  short telescopic whip outdoors decodes ring alerts.
- For Orbcomm: an antenna for 137 MHz - a telescopic whip at about 52 cm, or a V-dipole with
  two arms of about 53 cm opened to 120 degrees (the classic 137 MHz satellite antenna).
- For the ISS / ham satellites: a whip of about 49 cm (19 1/4 in) for 2 m or 16.5 cm (6 1/2 in)
  for 70 cm, or a 2 m / 70 cm dual-band whip.
- For GPS / Galileo: an active GPS antenna (the usual puck with an SMA plug, 3-5 V) and an SDR
  with a bias-T to power it.


INSTALLING FROM GITHUB (only if you have no "python" folder)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The ready-made zip already holds its own Python. The GitHub repository holds only the source,
so the Python folder (Python, GNU Radio and the decoders) is built on your PC once:
1. Get the code into a folder you can write to (not "Program Files"): with Git for Windows
   (https://gitforwindows.org), "git clone https://github.com/TCarmickle/satellite-tracker.git",
   or on GitHub: Code > Download ZIP. Git is only needed if you want to pull updates.
2. Install Miniforge once (https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge): the
   Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe installer, "Just Me", default folder. Adding it to PATH is not
   needed.
3. In a Command Prompt, in this folder, run:
       %USERPROFILE%\miniforge3\python.exe build\build_runtime.py
   It downloads about 1 GB and leaves a "python" folder of about 550-650 MB; it takes several
   minutes. Use Miniforge's Python as shown - a plain "python" is often only the Microsoft Store
   shortcut. BUILDING.md has the details.
4. Then install the USB driver (next section) and carry on with STARTING.


ONE-TIME SETUP: THE USB DRIVER (needs administrator rights)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Windows needs the WinUSB driver for the SDR. This cannot be bundled, and Windows does not
install it by itself. Without it the tracker's window opens normally, but "Start receiver"
stops at once with "the SDR ... could not be opened", and the receiver log
(data\captures\output-*.log) shows "usb_open error -5" and "Failed to open rtlsdr device".
1. Plug in the SDR - preferably into a USB 2.0 port straight on the PC: USB 3.0 ports give off
   radio noise near L-band, and hubs shared with other devices have dropped the SDR.
2. Download Zadig from https://zadig.akeo.ie and run it (Windows asks for administrator rights).
3. Options menu > List All Devices.
4. Pick "Bulk-In, Interface (Interface 0)" - USB ID 0BDA 2838 00 on most RTL-SDRs (some show
   "RTL2838UHIDIR"). NOT Interface 1, and never a device you don't recognise: replacing the
   driver of a keyboard, mouse or headset stops it working.
5. Make sure the driver on the right says WinUSB, then click "Replace Driver" (or "Install Driver").
6. Unplug the SDR and plug it back in.
You normally do this once per computer: Windows keeps the driver for that SDR model on every USB
port. Do it again on a new or reinstalled PC, if Windows Update replaces the driver, or for a
different SDR model.

Checking the driver: open Device Manager (right-click Start > Device Manager). Under "Universal
Serial Bus devices" there should be "Bulk-In, Interface"; its Properties > Driver tab says the
provider is libwdi. A second "Bulk-In, Interface" with a yellow warning under "Other devices" is
normal - that is the dongle's infrared remote receiver, which is not used. If the SDR only shows
under "Other devices", or under "Sound, video and game controllers" as a TV tuner (Windows' own
DVB-T driver), run Zadig again.


STARTING
--------
1. Keep this whole folder somewhere you can write to (Desktop, Documents...),
   NOT in "Program Files". Captures and the catalog are saved inside it.
2. Double-click "Satellite Tracker.bat".
3. The first time, the map asks you to CLICK YOUR ANTENNA'S LOCATION. Zoom in with the mouse
   wheel (drag to move) and click your house; the height there is looked up automatically
   (the point is sent to open-meteo.com). "Type coordinates..." lets you enter it instead.
   To change it later, click the location button (pin) at the top right of the window.
   It is saved in data\settings.json.
4. Press the green "Start receiver" button at the top. Close SDR++, SatDump or any other
   program using the SDR first - only one program can use it at a time.
5. Press "Stop receiver" when you're done. The capture is then decoded into the catalog
   automatically, and the satellites you heard get their orbits.

Ring alerts with positions come in when a satellite passes over or near you; give it at
least 30-60 minutes outdoors. In the list on the right, click a satellite to see every
position it sent you and how good its orbit is.


CHOOSING YOUR SDR (Source button)
---------------------------------
The "Source" button next to Start receiver works like SDR++'s source menu:
- Device: the SDRs found on this PC (Refresh to look again), an RTL-SDR shared over the network
  (RTL-TCP: rtl_tcp=host:port), or any gr-osmosdr device string (hackrf=0, airspy=0, rtl=1,
  soapy=0,driver=...).
- Sample rate: RTL-SDRs 2.0-2.5 MS/s. Wider SDRs (HackRF, Airspy, bladeRF) can take up to
  10-20 MS/s and cover the whole Iridium band (1616-1626.5 MHz).
- Frequency: Automatic keeps the ring-alert channels (1626.0-1626.5 MHz) in view.
- Gain (or Auto), PPM correction, Bias-T (powers an active antenna or LNA through the coax),
  offset tuning and DC correction. IQ correction is off by default: gr-osmosdr's automatic IQ
  balance creates a mirror image of every burst, which can't be decoded.
- IF gain (E4000 tuners), per band. Too low and weak signals are lost in the SDR's 8-bit
  rounding - GPS went from 0-2 satellites to 5+ when it was raised. Tune gain finds the best
  value for a band in about 10 seconds (receiver stopped, the band's antenna connected). The
  'Input' level next to the spectrum shows how much of the converter is used: 5-30% is good.
- Burst threshold: how far over the noise a burst must be. 14 dB is the minimum - lower floods
  the decoder with false bursts and can run the PC out of memory.
Changes apply the next time you start the receiver.


SATELLITE INFO (click a satellite)
----------------------------------
Clicking a satellite on the map, the globe or in the list opens a window about it, with tabs:
  About          its launch (date and mission), block, hardware, the public catalog's orbit, and
                 how your receiver identified it
  Doppler curve  each pass's measured frequency shift plotted against the predicted curve it was
                 matched to: when it was closest, how high it was, and how much better it matched
                 than the next-best satellite
  Heard          every pass you picked it up (double-click one to jump the timeline there)
  Orbit          our own orbit for it, compared with the public catalog's
Launch and catalog facts come from the public CelesTrak list; the map and globe still use only
your own observations.


GLOBE (Globe button)
--------------------
The same picture as the map, on a 3D globe: the satellites at their orbital height, the
orbital-plane rings, the selected satellite's past (orange) and future (yellow) path, your
position fixes (red) and you. The night side is shaded from the Sun's real position. Anything
behind the Earth is drawn faintly. Drag to move around the Earth, mouse wheel to zoom,
right-drag up/down to tilt and left/right to turn, "Center on me" (or double-click) to come
back to your location,
click a satellite to select it. "Top view" looks straight down; "Side view" looks across the
Earth towards the horizon, with the orbits arching over it. "Stand here" shows the sky as if you
were standing at your location - the satellites passing overhead, with the compass along the
horizon and lines 30 and 60 degrees up; drag to look around, wheel to zoom. It follows the timeline, so Play
and scrubbing move the satellites on the globe too.


SKY PLOT (Sky button)
---------------------
Where in your sky the satellites were when your antenna heard them: the centre is straight
overhead, the edge is the horizon, north is up and east is right. Big dots are position fixes
(coloured by signal strength); the shading is everything else heard from identified satellites,
counted in 3-degree patches of sky (brighter = more heard). Empty
areas are directions or heights your antenna can't hear - a house or roof in the way, or the
antenna's blind spot (a vertical whip hears little straight up). Move the antenna and watch the
empty areas fill in; "Heard in" picks this run (the default), the last hour, the last day or
everything. Every reception counts (a GNSS session adds one a second per satellite), and the
plot only refreshes while it is on screen.
Signal (button): instead of how much was heard, colours each 5-degree patch by the middle
signal level (C/N0, 25-45 dB-Hz) of the GNSS satellites that passed through it - each placed by
its own broadcast orbit. This is the map for placing the antenna: the summary underneath names
the weakest direction ("Weakest towards W, 5 dB below SE - something there shades the antenna")
and how often GPS satellites that were up in each direction and height were actually locked.
A satellite drawn with a white dashed ring is 'heard, not tracked': once a minute the receiver
searches one second of its own samples for GPS satellites that are up but that PocketSDR has
not locked, and lists those it finds (with a rough level, ~24-33 dB-Hz) - they are there, just
weak. Never drawn as a position or an orbit; tested offline: 0 false finds in 453 searches of
satellites below the horizon.


SYSTEMS: IRIDIUM, ORBCOMM, ISS AND HAM SATELLITES
--------------------------------------------------
One SDR listens to one band at a time, so pick what to receive - in the box next to Start
receiver, or in Source:
  Iridium        (1.6 GHz)  antenna about 4.6 cm, or a patch antenna facing up
  Orbcomm        (137 MHz)  antenna about 52 cm (whip), or a V-dipole of 2 x 53 cm at 120 degrees
  ISS & ham 2 m  (145 MHz)  antenna about 49 cm (19 1/4 in)
  Ham 70 cm      (436 MHz)  antenna about 16.5 cm (6 1/2 in)
  GNSS L1 (GPS)  (1575 MHz) an active GPS antenna, straight into the SDR (see GNSS below)
Change the antenna to match, then press Start. Each band keeps its own gain. Every band but
Iridium has a fixed sample rate and frequency, set for its decoders.

Orbcomm satellites send an "ephemeris" packet every few seconds with their own position and
velocity. The receiver decodes all eight downlink channels at once, names each satellite by
where it says it is, and fits its orbit from those positions (and the Doppler shift of every
packet), just like Iridium. On the map Orbcomm satellites have orange-edged solar panels and
"OC" labels; Iridium ones are "IR".

ISS and ham satellites: the receiver watches the whole 2 m or 70 cm slice. When a signal appears
it measures the signal's exact frequency (its Doppler shift) and tries the gr-satellites decoders
of the satellites that transmit near there (about 400 satellites are known). A frame that passes
its checksum names the satellite:
  - the ISS: only APRS packets the ISS itself repeated (RS0ISS / NA1SS in the path) - people on
    the ground use the same frequency, and those packets are ignored
  - a CubeSat: only if no other satellite uses the same frequency and signal; frames from shared
    frequencies are shown in the log as "could be ..." but not credited to any satellite
Frame contents are never saved - only that a frame was heard, when, at what frequency and from
which callsign. These satellites don't send their own position, so they appear in the list
(with their Doppler curves) but not on the map until their orbit can be worked out from Doppler
alone.

Everything you have received is always shown; the system buttons above the satellite list
(All / Iridium / Orbcomm / ISS & ham / GNSS, each with how many satellites it has) filter the
map, list, globe and sky plot, and the boxes under them sum up the system you picked.
Iridium's orbital-plane rings are Iridium only.

Sound: the Audio menu (next to the spectrum) has a Mode (NFM, WFM, AM, USB, LSB, CW) and a
Bandwidth for the tuned sound; each band starts on its own default (ham: NFM). To hear the ISS's
voice contacts or SSTV events, tune to 145.800 MHz on NFM.


GNSS: GPS AND GALILEO (1575.42 MHz)
-----------------------------------
GPS and Galileo satellites all transmit on 1575.42 MHz. Their signals are weaker than the radio
noise - nothing shows in the spectrum - but a GNSS receiver digs them out by correlating with
each satellite's code. The tracker uses PocketSDR (by T. Takasu, the author of RTKLIB) for that.

Antenna: an ACTIVE GPS antenna (it has an amplifier inside, powered through the coax). Plug it
straight into the SDR and turn on Bias-T in Source (some SDRs, like the SMArTee XTR, power the
antenna all the time). It needs open sky: outdoors, or at least in a window. A metal plate under
a puck antenna (10 cm or more across) helps - it blocks signals bouncing off the ground.

Pick "GNSS L1 (GPS)" next to Start receiver and press Start. The receiver streams the signal
straight into PocketSDR, which tracks the satellites live: they show up as they lock on (usually
within a minute or two) and stay locked, and their updates arrive every second or two. Leave it
running at least 10-15 minutes.
  - The status bar at the bottom right shows your position from the receiver, how many
    satellites it came from, and whether it is the own solver's (WAAS-corrected) or pocket_trk's:
    green while a new position arrives every second, amber when they come slower (too few
    satellites, or poor geometry at times), and the plain home setting after 30 s without one.
  - Satellites it tracks appear in the list ("GPS G06", "Galileo E18") with their Doppler
    curves, as "Doppler only, no orbit" at first.
    A satellite counts as tracked after 5 s of steady signal (Galileo: 10 s at 30 dB-Hz, because
    its weak locks came and went every 10-30 s), or at once when its orbit is decoded.
  - Once a satellite has been tracked long enough (about 30 seconds of strong, unbroken signal)
    its broadcast orbit (ephemeris) is decoded: the satellite's own description of its orbit.
    It then goes on the map and globe at its real height (about 20,200 km) with a full orbit,
    and the summary box counts it under "with broadcast orbit".
  - With 4 or more broadcast orbits the receiver works out where YOU are: the log shows
    "FIX  pocket_trk: N satellites" (and "FIX  own solver: ..." once our own solver has settled;
    see WAAS-CORRECTED POSITION), then only changes - "FIX LOST ... 4 GPS tracked, HDOP 6.6 > 6",
    "LOST  GPS G24 after 25 min". It should land near the location you set (within a kilometre
    or so) - a good check of the whole chain. The position panel's second line says what the
    solver is doing right now ("Own solver: no fix - 3 GPS (needs 4): G10 G23 G32; pocket_trk
    fixing with 4 GPS + 1 Galileo"), so an outage explains itself.
  - A satellite counts as tracked after 5 seconds at 25 dB-Hz or more (or as soon as its orbit
    arrives); one-second false locks no longer make rows, events or the new-satellite sound.
  - Sample-stream gaps: the SDR's USB link can lose samples (100-140 ms, a few times a day). The
    receiver fills a real loss with exactly as many zeros so the satellites stay locked and writes
    "STREAM GAP 110 ms of samples lost (USB) - filled" in the log. Since 7 November it first checks
    the signal itself: samples that only arrive late, with nothing missing, are left alone (the
    log says "samples arrived 48 ms late, but the signal runs on without a break - nothing
    filled"). Filling those by mistake was what made every satellite drop at once every few
    minutes on 6-7 November. If a gap still gets past it (pocket_trk then rejects
    every range as out of range and would never fix again) pocket_trk is restarted within half a
    minute ("RESTART pocket_trk lost its clock after a gap"). Before this, one such gap ended
    the positioning for the rest of a run while the satellites still looked locked. The gaps are
    counted in the capture's .log; if you see many, try another USB port (a USB 2.0 port on
    another root hub), unplug other USB storage (a Garmin in drive mode), or turn off USB
    selective suspend in the Windows power plan.
  - The SDR dropping off USB: Windows sometimes drops the SDR from the USB bus ("surprise
    removed" in its event log - 13 times on 4-7 November, once together with a USB headset
    dongle on the same hub). The receiver now notices (the driver says so, or no samples arrive
    for 10 s), ends the capture and opens the SDR again by itself every 10 s for about 5 minutes
    ("The SDR dropped off USB - opening it again"). Before, it sat with no samples until Stop was
    pressed. If it keeps happening, move the SDR to a USB port on the back of the PC (straight on
    the motherboard, not a hub or the front panel) and away from other busy USB devices.
  - pocket_trk's own log and RTCM output of each run are kept beside the capture
    (<capture>.trk1.log / .trk1.rtcm: the raw ranges, carrier phases, navigation bits and events)
    and trimmed with the capture under the storage limits - the complete record of a session for
    later analysis.
A broadcast orbit is accurate to a few metres for about 4 hours and slowly gets less certain
after that; the next run refreshes it (each satellite sends a fresh one every couple of hours).
BeiDou is not received (PocketSDR decodes no BeiDou orbit at this frequency, and searching its
codes would slow the GPS and Galileo search). A GPS orbit takes 12 hours, so its track
on the flat map sweeps from about 55 degrees south to 55 north and back across half the world;
on the globe it is a ring around the Earth.

WAAS (in the same band, at the same time): the FAA's GPS-correction satellites are geostationary
(35,786 km up, over the equator, south of you) and send a GPS-like signal on 1575.42 MHz. The
receiver tracks the North American ones too (WAAS 131, 133, 135) and decodes the position each
one broadcasts every couple of minutes, so they appear as "WAAS 131" and so on, standing still
in your southern sky.

GLONASS (its own band - pick "GNSS L1 (GLONASS)" next to Start): Russia's navigation satellites
send on about 1602 MHz, each satellite on its own frequency channel. The SDR's slice covers the
middle channels (about 5 of 14), so several GLONASS satellites at a time, not all. Each one's
broadcast orbit (position and velocity every 30 minutes) is integrated forward, as GLONASS
receivers do; it agrees with the public catalog to tens of km over hours. Your antenna has to
cover 1602 MHz - most GPS pucks do. GLONASS can't be received at the same time as GPS: one SDR
hears one band at a time.

BeiDou (its own band - "GNSS B1I (BeiDou)"): China's navigation satellites on 1561.098 MHz, the
same GPS antenna. Every BeiDou satellite sends B1I with its broadcast orbit, so they get orbits
like GPS (checked: within ~20 km of the public catalog). The decoder's channel number is not
always the satellite's real number, so each one is named by where its own decoded orbit puts it
(the nearest satellite in the public list, names only); its tracking appears once its orbit has
been decoded, usually within a minute or two.

Offset tuning (Source, on by default for the E4000 tuner) keeps the SDR's own spike at the
centre frequency off the signal. If nothing is tracked after 10 minutes: check the antenna has
sky, Bias-T is on, and try a higher gain in Source.


ACTIVITY LIGHTS
---------------
Next to the receiver status, two small lights flash for every burst: green (top) = a message
was decoded, red (bottom) = a damaged burst that couldn't be decoded. In the satellite list, the
light at the left of each satellite flashes green when a frame from that satellite comes in
(identified by its network ID or plane/slot). Damaged bursts can't be traced to a satellite -
the part saying which satellite sent them is what couldn't be decoded.


SPECTRUM AND WATERFALL
----------------------
Under the map, while receiving: the live spectrum (top) and waterfall (bottom) of exactly what
the decoder hears - each Iridium burst shows up as a short dash in the waterfall. The ring-alert
and messaging channels are shaded green, the phone channels blue.
- Mouse wheel over the waterfall zooms in on a frequency (both views), drag moves along,
  double-click shows everything. Mouse wheel over the spectrum trace steps the tuned sound
  frequency 1 kHz per click (10 kHz with Shift).
- Hover to read the frequency and level (and how long ago, in the waterfall).
- Auto range keeps the noise dark and bursts bright; untick it to set Min / Max yourself.
- Peak hold draws the strongest level seen at each frequency - handy when aiming an antenna.
- The Spectrum button at the top hides or shows it; drag the divider to resize it.
- Sound (in the spectrum toolbar): hear the radio like SDR++ - static, with a click or "zzt"
  for each burst. "Whole band" plays every burst the receiver hears; "Tuned" plays one channel -
  click the spectrum to choose it (the yellow marker). Nothing is decoded into speech.
  The GNSS bands have sound too, but it is only the band's hiss: navigation signals lie under
  the noise, so you hear static (and any interference), never the satellites themselves.
  "Audio" next to the volume: an optional low-pass (softer, less hiss) and high-pass (less
  rumble) filter, and a squelch that mutes the static and opens only for bursts louder than the
  noise by the amount you set. Your choices are remembered.


RADIO (the Radio section - listen anywhere, like SDR++)
--------------------------------------------------------
Click "Radio" at the top for a big spectrum and waterfall and a tuner for any frequency the SDR
reaches (about 24 MHz to 2.3 GHz): FM radio, NOAA Weather Radio, aircraft, ham, marine...
- The big digits are the frequency: scroll over any digit to step it (each digit is its own
  place - 1 MHz, 100 kHz, 10 kHz ... 1 Hz), or click its top half (up) / bottom half (down).
  Or type it in MHz and press Enter, or pick one from "Quick picks".
- Your own favourites: "★ Save frequency" saves where you are (with its mode and bandwidth)
  to the bar under the digits, with a name you choose. Click one any time - this session or
  the next - to go straight there (it starts Radio if nothing is receiving). Right-click one
  to rename it, update it to where you are now, move it left / right, or delete it. Saved
  frequencies in view are starred on the spectrum.
- If another band is being received (Iridium, GPS...) and you tune outside its slice - digits,
  typing or a quick pick - it stops that band (its capture is kept as usual) and starts Radio
  at the new frequency.
- The main view (Tracker section): the buttons above the map - Map, Globe, Sky, Signal - choose
  what fills it. "Pop out" puts the view shown there into a window of its own (the header's
  Sky / Globe / Signal buttons open theirs as windows too, as before); closing a window brings
  the view back. The main view you chose and each window's size and place are remembered.
- The waveform and the waterfall each have a pop-out button on the spectrum bar (in every
  section), and the timeline has one at the end of its controls. A popped-out waveform or
  waterfall works like the one in the window: click to tune, drag the yellow band's edges...
- The waveform's dB scale (its left edge) can be dragged: its top half moves the top of the
  range (drag down to bring the top down), its bottom half the bottom; the wheel there zooms
  the range. That turns Auto range off - tick it again to go back.
- Sizes are yours to set, in every section: drag the bar with the frequency scale (the grips
  at its ends) up or down to give the spectrum line or the waterfall more room, and drag the
  dividers between panels. The window's size and place, every divider, and the spectrum /
  waterfall split (one for each section) are remembered for next time.
- Drag the spectrum sideways to slide along the band (drag left = up in frequency); the SDR
  moves when you let go. The labels under the spectrum show what is where (FM radio, aircraft,
  marine, NOAA Weather Radio, ham bands, TV, cell phones, ADS-B, GPS...).
- The digits go from 0 Hz up, but the SDR receives about 24 MHz - 2.3 GHz (E4000 tuners from
  about 52 MHz); outside that it stays at the nearest end and says so.
- Press "Start radio" (this uses the receiver on the Radio band). Turn the volume up on the
  spectrum bar. When the frequency leaves the slice the SDR is receiving (2 MHz wide), the
  SDR moves with it.
- Mode: NFM (voice, weather radio), WFM (FM broadcast), AM (aircraft), USB / LSB (ham sideband),
  CW (Morse). Bandwidth: the slider or the box - or drag the edges of the yellow band on the
  spectrum, in any section: grab an edge (the pointer turns into arrows) and drag it out or in.
- Click the spectrum to listen there; the scroll wheel over the spectrum line steps 1 kHz
  (10 kHz with Shift); over the waterfall it zooms.
- While another band is being received (Iridium, GPS...), the Radio section can listen anywhere
  in that band's slice; to go anywhere else, stop it and press Start radio.


WEATHER PICTURES (the Images section)
-------------------------------------
Click "Images" at the top to switch from the tracker to the pictures received from the
Meteor-M weather satellites (Russia; LRPT on 137.9 MHz, a pass every few hours, about 15 min).
- To receive one: during a pass press "Receive a Meteor pass" (or choose "Meteor-M weather
  pictures" as the receiver band and press Start receiver). The status line shows the signal
  over the noise every couple of seconds - a few dB or more is good. Press Stop when the
  satellite has set; a minute or two later the pictures appear in Images.
- Antenna: a whip about 21 in / 53 cm long (a quarter wave at 137.9 MHz - a telescopic one
  pulled out that far), upright on something metal, outdoors with open sky. The higher the
  pass goes, the better the picture.
- The pictures are made by SatDump (free, open source, GPL-3.0 - https://www.satdump.org):
  install it with its Windows installer; the tracker finds it in C:\Program Files\SatDump.
  While receiving, the pass is recorded (about 1 GB, deleted once its pictures are made; a
  recording that gave no pictures is kept so "Make pictures again" can retry it).
- Click a pass, then a picture: scroll to zoom, drag to move, double-click to fit. "Save as..."
  copies it anywhere; "Open" opens it in your picture viewer.
- Passes received with SatDump itself: "Import a SatDump folder..." copies their pictures in.
- The Satellite Console shows the signal during a Meteor pass too (band 7).
- Pictures are kept in data\images (one folder per pass).


THE CONSOLE (more detail)
-------------------------
Double-click "Satellite Console.bat" for a line-by-line view of the receiver, like a radio log,
on whichever band it is on (shown at the top, with the frequency it is tuned to):
- Iridium: every decoded frame with its type, signal and frequency, ring alerts with the
  satellite's name and position, damaged bursts, and the decoder's status every 10 s.
- Orbcomm: each packet, and the satellites' own positions (ephemeris packets).
- ISS / ham: each frame with the satellite and callsign (never its contents).
- GNSS (GPS, Galileo, WAAS, GLONASS): each satellite as it is acquired, then its signal
  (dB-Hz), Doppler and lock every 15 s, when it is lost, its broadcast orbit as it is
  decoded, and the receiver's own position fixes.
- It watches whatever the tracker's receiver is doing, so you can run both together.
- Or receive from the console without the tracker (close the tracker's receiver first):
  press 1-7 to choose the band (Iridium, Orbcomm, ISS & ham 2 m, ham 70 cm, GPS L1,
  GLONASS L1, Meteor-M pictures - it starts on the tracker's last one), then R. Press R again or Q to stop;
  the capture goes into the catalog. The choice is the console's only: the tracker keeps its own.
- B turns beeps on/off (short = not decoded, long = decoded, extra long = a position).
  D shows/hides what was heard but not decoded.
- From the command line: Satellite Console.bat --band gnss1 --receive
  (bands: iridium orbcomm ham2m ham70 gnss1 glo1)
- To list a finished capture:  Satellite Console.bat --capture output-<date-time>
  (or gnss-..., glo-..., orbcomm-..., ham2m-..., ham70-...)


YOUR DATA (all in the data folder, next to app)
-----------------------------------------------
Updating or replacing the program never touches the data folder. Click the disk button at the
top right of the tracker to see how much space it uses, change the limits, or clean up.

settings.json              your antenna location and storage limits
catalog-data.json          everything heard so far (satellites, planes, positions) - never
                           deleted; this is what the tracker shows

captures\                  one set of files per receiver run:

                                of the size) - enough to rebuild the catalog
  (Orbcomm, ham and GNSS runs are named orbcomm-, ham- and gnss-<date-time> and keep only the
  lines the tracker uses: positions, Doppler, broadcast orbits and fixes; a GNSS run with a
  Garmin recorded beside it also has gnss-<date-time>.garmin, a raw file like .live - the
  catalog keeps its comparison)
tiles\                     cached map pictures from OpenStreetMap

Keeping it small: once a capture is in the catalog, its raw files (.bits .live .log) are
deleted after 7 days, or sooner if they add up to more than 1 GB (oldest first). The map
cache is kept under 200 MB, and receiving stops if the disk gets below 1 GB free. All four
limits can be changed in the disk panel. Raw files hold every burst the receiver heard,
including other people's voice and message bursts (never decoded) - set "Keep raw
recordings" to 0 days to delete them as soon as a capture is in the catalog.


PRIVACY AND THE LAW
-------------------
The tracker only uses technical frames (ring alerts, time & location, Doppler). It does not
decode or play voice or messages. Iridium phone calls and messages are private
communications; in many countries (including the US) listening to their content or sharing
it is illegal. Don't.
If you share your capture files or catalog, remember they contain your location.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
"the SDR could not be opened"   The SDR is unplugged, the WinUSB driver isn't installed, or
                                another program (SDR++, SatDump...) is using it. If the
                                receiver log says "usb_open error -5", it is the driver: see
                                "THE USB DRIVER" near the top.
"decoder used over 2 GB"        Too many false bursts - the threshold is too low or there is
                                strong interference. It stops itself to protect the computer.
Nothing decoded                 Check the antenna is outside with sky view; Iridium is at
                                1616-1626.5 MHz.
Errors                          See data\tracker-error.log and the receiver logs
                                (data\captures\*.log).

CATALOG SAFETY
--------------
The catalog (everything received) is now one file per capture in data\catalog, each saved to a
temporary file first and swapped in (see below); the old catalog-data.json and its previous copy
are still read if the new folder isn't there yet. (Before this, an interrupted save on 5 Nov 2026 cut the file off and the
tracker showed no history until it was repaired: the complete entries were recovered and the
captures still on disk were analyzed again.)
PC CLOCK FROM GPS
-----------------
While the GNSS L1 (GPS) receiver has a position fix, Settings (the cog) > PC clock shows how far
this PC's clock is from GPS time (accurate to a few milliseconds - the receiver times each fix
from the SDR's sample count). 'Set PC clock to GPS time' moves the Windows clock by that much;
Windows asks for permission first.

YOUR POSITION ACCURACY
----------------------
In the Navigation view, under the number boxes: how good your own GNSS position is, from the last
10 minutes of position fixes (hover it for the breakdown):
  - 95 % radius (R95): 95 % of the fixes fall within this distance of their middle - the usual
    GPS accuracy figure - graded under 5 m excellent, 10 good, 25 fair, 50 poor, beyond that bad;
    CEP50 is the radius holding half of them; the height wanders about twice as much.
  - Drift: how far the middle of the fixes moved over the window (the first two minutes against
    the last two). The antenna doesn't move, so this is the satellites and the atmosphere.
  - HDOP: the satellites' geometry, from their own orbits. Spread over the sky is good (under 2);
    bunched up is poor (over 5). Expected 95 % error ~ 2 x HDOP x 5 m.
  - From home: the middle of the fixes against the location in Settings.
  - Average: how sure the middle of the recent fixes is (95 %). Single fixes jump, but their
    middle settles: errors are taken to last at least 2 minutes, so 10 minutes of fixes count as
    about 5 independent ones (needs 5+ minutes; a 10-minute average is about +-3 m with the
    WAAS-corrected fixes here, about +-10 m with pocket_trk's).
  - All sessions: every GNSS session in the catalog, each one's middle, and their average; how
    sure that is comes from how much the sessions disagree (other days, times, satellites), so it
    tightens as sessions are added. Uses the WAAS-corrected fixes once there are 3+ sessions of
    them. (Checked against a Garmin GPSMAP 64st left 10 minutes beside the antenna: its average
    was 1.5 m from the home location.)
Measured here with the current antenna (4-6 satellites): about 20-25 m (95 %), half within
6-9 m, drift 2-5 m over 8 minutes. Needs 30 fixes; fixes a second apart aren't independent, so
the full 10 minutes gives the honest figure.
WAAS-CORRECTED POSITION (our own solver)
----------------------------------------
On the GNSS L1 (GPS) band the tracker also works out the position itself (app\spp.py) from
pocket_trk's raw measurements, in two steps pocket_trk doesn't take:
  - carrier smoothing: each satellite's range is carried forward on its carrier phase (smooth to
    millimetres) and only nudged by the noisy code range (100 s, as WAAS receivers do);
  - WAAS corrections from the WAAS satellites (WAAS 131 / 133 / 135, the GEO satellites in the
    list): each GPS satellite's orbit and clock error (long-term and fast corrections, message
    types 2-5, 24, 25) and the ionosphere delay over a 5-degree grid (types 18 and 26).
WAAS doesn't give a position by itself; it corrects the GPS satellites. Its fixes (GSPP lines,
kept in the catalog) are used by the 'Your position' line and 'Use GPS-tracked position' when
there are enough; the line then says 'WAAS-corrected' and shows pocket_trk's own figure next to it.
When the own solver has had no fix for a minute the headline goes grey and says why ("No fix for
17 min - 3 GPS (needs 4): G10 G23 G32"); pocket_trk's figures are then labelled as its own, not
as "Your position". 'Use GPS-tracked position' takes only settled WAAS-corrected fixes with 4 or
more satellites from the last 10 minutes (at least 30 of them; pocket_trk's fixes with 5 or more
satellites only when there are none) and its tooltip says how good that average is - the first
quick fixes can be 10-30 m off and are no longer averaged in.
Measured on 8 recorded sessions here: 95 % within 3-10 m (pocket_trk 11-30 m), half within
1-4 m (pocket_trk 4-9 m), and the sessions' middle positions agree with each other to 1.4 m rms
horizontally and 5 m in height (pocket_trk 2.4 m and 8.5 m). Each satellite is left to settle
for 30 s after it locks before its smoothing starts (a just-locked satellite's code range is
still pulling in, and that start would stay in the average - seen against a Garmin GPSMAP 64st
beside the antenna); fixes then start once 4 satellites have been smoothed for 30 s (about two
minutes after starting the receiver), and only with good geometry (HDOP 6 or better). GPS's own ionosphere model is kept in data\gnss-solver.json
between sessions. Galileo joins when 2 or more Galileo satellites have decoded orbits.
Static antenna: the antenna never moves, so the solver also uses its height - learned from its
own earlier fixes (first from the catalog's sessions, then kept up to date in gnss-solver.json;
never from the home setting, whose height comes from an internet terrain map). With it, 4
satellites in a poor line-up or a single Galileo satellite still give a position, and 3 give a
quick one. On recorded sessions this filled every gap the geometry rule used to leave (5920 good
fixes where there were 2914 in the same 100 minutes) and tightened the 95 % figure (5.5 -> 4.8 m,
6.4 -> 3.5 m with Galileo). The height is checked all the time against fixes that don't need it:
if they disagree (the antenna was moved up or down) it is dropped and learned again over 15
minutes. Heights of fixes the height held are not used in the height figures.
If you move the antenna up or down yourself (to a roof, a pole, another floor), open Settings >
Location and press "Forget the learned height" under GNSS antenna height: the solver then
learns the new one from 15 minutes of its own 5-satellite fixes (the receiver may keep running).
WARM START, SATELLITES NOT HEARD, REFERENCE POINTS, GPX
-------------------------------------------------------
Ideas taken from how a Garmin GPSMAP 64st works (its chip keeps orbit predictions and its last
position between uses; its data is many small standard files):
  - Warm start: every orbit decoded is kept in data\gnss-solver.json (with GPS's ionosphere
    model); at the next start our own solver has them at once and gives a quick first fix as soon
    as 4 satellites are locked (measured: 4-11 s before pocket_trk's own; most of the start-up is
    pocket_trk finding and syncing to the satellites). Quick fixes count as the first fix but not
    in the accuracy figures, which wait for the smoothing.
  - 'Up but not heard': while receiving GNSS L1 (GPS), the position panel lists satellites whose
    own orbits put them 15 degrees or more up but that aren't being tracked - a long list means the
    antenna's view of the sky is blocked (a handheld lying on it did exactly that).
  - Start-up history: the tooltip shows this session's first fixes and the median of the last ten.
  - Almanac: every GPS and Galileo satellite also sends a rough plan of the whole constellation
    (12.5 minutes for all of GPS). The receiver decodes it (GALM lines, kept 4 weeks in
    gnss-solver.json with the leap seconds and the GPS-Galileo time offset), and uses it for
    'Up but not heard', for which satellites are worth searching for, and in a satellite's info
    window for its next pass when there is no orbit. It is only good to a few km (measured: 1-2 km
    within 3 days, ~8 km after 6), so it is labelled 'almanac' and never drawn as the satellite.
  - Orbit history: every broadcast orbit decoded is kept, and the map, globe and sky plot use the
    one that was valid at the timeline time - scrubbing back a day no longer draws a satellite
    from today's orbit (that was 0.5 km off for GPS, 8-16 km for WAAS). Leap seconds now come from
    the satellites' own UTC message, not a fixed 18.
  - A GNSS satellite's info window has a Signal tab: its level against its height in the sky over
    all its passes, and a fading figure per pass ('S4-like from 1 Hz C/N0'). Around 0.05-0.1 is
    the level the measurement's own noise gives (a quiet sky); clearly higher minutes mean the
    signal was fading - the ionosphere, or the satellite passing behind something.
  - The catalog keeps each pass's signal level every second and its Doppler every 10 s (it was
    the other way round): 26 MB became 10 MB on 50 sessions. Old entries still load; the new
    figures appear for old captures after one 'catalog.py --redo'.
  - Searching only for the satellites that are up (gnss_rx.py --narrow-search) is there but off:
    on a recording it locked fewer satellites, as pocket_trk already searches all in parallel.
  - pocket_trk's own settings: data\pocket_trk.opt (lines like 'lost_th = 10', '#' for comments)
    is passed to it, and the command and settings used are written into the capture's .log. The
    file ships with two values measured on recordings: 'lost_th = 10' - by default pocket_trk
    dropped half of the satellites it found at 34-36 dB-Hz after exactly 2 seconds, because its
    phase loop got one second to lock after the frequency pull-in; and 'b_dll = 0.5' - its
    default code-loop bandwidth lost every Galileo E1B satellite after about 10 seconds, which is
    why Galileo orbits rarely decoded. Lowering the acquisition threshold ('thres_cn0_l') alone
    finds weak satellites but locks noise below 33, so it stays at 34.
  - Catalog: one file per capture in data\catalog (plus index.json) instead of one big file - a
    bad write costs at most one capture, and a save rewrites only what changed. The old
    catalog-data.json is read once and left in place. Each GNSS capture also keeps its session
    statistics (first-fix times, satellites, signal, middle position, accuracy).
  - Reference points (right-click the position panel): save your long-term average, or import a
    GPX file - waypoints near home and stretches where a track sat still 3+ minutes become points.
    A Garmin plugged in as a drive is imported by itself (its GPX files are copied to
    data\garmin). Star the one beside the antenna (or name one 'antenna'): the panel then measures
    against it instead of the home location. A track stretch only becomes a point when it is
    dense (60+ points, one every 2 s or better - set the Garmin's track log to 1 s) and steady (95 %
    within 10 m); if nothing is starred, the tightest such stretch within 25 m of home is starred for
    you, and the panel says "from home (no reference starred)" while there is none. A Garmin's
    heights are its barometer, which drifts tens of metres in hours: they are shown as such and
    never used as a height reference. The 10-minute average's "+-" figure is now set per source (our
    solver's errors last minutes, pocket_trk's seconds) and the "all N sessions" figure appears from
    4 sessions on, widened for how few there are.
  - GPX export (right-click): every session's fixes, pocket_trk's and the WAAS-corrected, as
    tracks, and the reference points as waypoints - for BaseCamp, Google Earth or QGIS.
  - Sea-level heights: a Garmin on the live USB link reports the local gap between GPS's ellipsoid
    and sea level (-19.3 m here, saved in data\geoid.json); heights in the tooltip and in GPX
    exports are then above sea level.
  - A Garmin handheld beside the antenna, live over USB: while GPS L1 (or another GNSS band) is
    receiving, a Garmin connected in its live mode is recorded next to the capture
    (<capture>.garmin - checked at the start and every 30 s, so it can be plugged in later; the
    recorder stops with the capture and with the tracker). After Stop the catalog compares the
    two second by second and satellite by satellite, and the position panel gets one line - live
    while it records, else for the last capture that had one - e.g. "Garmin beside you: 3D+WAAS,
    EPH 3 m, 2.1 m from our average; it holds G23 G27 (W, 20-60 deg) that we do not". Its tooltip
    has the same-second distances to our solver and to pocket_trk (median and 95 %), both
    middles, the Garmin's clock against this PC's (a cross-check of Settings > PC clock), and per
    satellite the seconds the Garmin heard / used it and we locked it, with where it was in the
    sky - the satellites it uses that we never lock are the direct measure of what our receiver
    misses. Only horizontal distances are compared (its heights are barometric), and never signal
    levels (its "SNR" is its own scale, unrelated to our C/N0). Its fixes count as the truth only
    when they are 3D+WAAS with EPH 5 m or better; without WAAS the line says so (a plain 3D fix
    indoors was 9 m from home with EPH 43 m - no better than ours). Set up the Garmin once:
      * Garmin's USB driver installed; Setup > System > Interface: Garmin Spanner;
      * answer "No" when it asks about mass storage on plugging in ("Yes" makes it a drive for
        the GPX import above, and then it can't be read live);
      * Setup > System > Satellite System: GPS + GLONASS, and WAAS/EGNOS: On;
      * put it 1-2 m from the GPS puck with a clear sky, never on top of it (it blocks the puck).
    By hand: 'python garmin_usb.py' prints what it receives, 'python garmin_usb.py log FILE'
    records it. Only one program can open the Garmin at a time.
PRECISE ANTENNA POSITION (offline, RINEX files)
-----------------------------------------------
For the antenna's position to decimetres rather than metres, pocket_trk's raw measurements (kept
beside every GNSS L1 (GPS) capture as <capture>.trk1.rtcm and .trk1.log) can be turned into RINEX
3.04, the standard file format that professional GNSS processing programs read. After Stop:
    cd C:\IridiumTracker\app
    ..\python\python.exe ..\tools\trk2rinex.py gnss-20261106-205411
This writes an observation file (...MO.rnx: code, carrier phase, Doppler and signal strength every
second) and a navigation file (...GN.rnx: the orbits our receiver decoded) into
data\rinex\<capture>\. It only writes files - nothing is sent anywhere. Options: --galileo (adds
Galileo), --no-sbas (leaves the WAAS satellites out), --out FOLDER. On the way it fixes two things
in pocket_trk's numbers a precise program would trip over: its code and carrier ranges drift apart
16.7 m every second (the SDR's tuner sits ~88 Hz off frequency) and its clock jumps 20-60 ms now
and then - the carrier is put onto the code's clock; and loss of lock is worked out from the carrier
itself (the RTCM's lock-time field restarts every ~72 s).
Record a long session first: the antenna must not move, open sky, 2 hours or more (longer is
better). Then either:
  - RTKLIB (free, rtklib.com or the "demo5" build; not included): download the nearest NGS CORS
    station's RINEX for the same hours (NOAA's CORS map; 30 s files are fine) and its published
    coordinates (X Y Z), then
      rnx2rtkp -p 3 -f 1 -sys G -m 15 -h -c -r X Y Z -o antenna.pos OUR_MO.rnx CORS.rnx OUR_GN.rnx
    (static, L1 only, GPS, elevation mask 15 degrees, fix-and-hold). The last lines of antenna.pos
    are the answer; Q=1 means the carrier ambiguities were fixed, Q=2 only float (less exact). The
    nearer the station the better - single-frequency works best within ~20 km.
  - NRCan CSRS-PPP (free web service of Natural Resources Canada, needs an account; no base station
    needed): upload the ...MO.rnx file, choose Static, single frequency is accepted. Note that this
    UPLOADS the file to NRCan, and the file holds your antenna's position (in its header, and the
    measurements themselves give it away) - your decision.
What to expect: not verified here yet (RTKLIB isn't installed on this PC and nothing has been
uploaded). From published results with L1-only receivers, a few hours of static data usually gives
a few decimetres (better if RTKLIB fixes the ambiguities against a near station); our carrier phase
is clean (~0.05 cycle) but this receiver holds only 5-8 GPS satellites and drops them often, and
the puck's phase centre is not calibrated (a few centimetres).
JAMMING AND SPOOFING WATCH (Integrity section)
----------------------------------------------
The Integrity section (header button) watches the GNSS L1 (GPS) band - GPS, Galileo and WAAS -
for someone drowning the satellites out (jamming) or faking
them (spoofing). Two verdicts at the top (clear / watch / ALERT), the checks under them, the
satellites tracked now, live charts of the last 30 minutes, and an event list (kept in the data
folder as integrity-events.jsonl). The header button turns amber or red from any section.
Arming: nothing counts as an event until the connection has proven itself - 4 or more satellites
at a median C/N0 of 33 dB-Hz or better for 2 minutes, with the quiet band learned and the noise at
that level (here GPS normally runs 4-7 satellites at ~36-38 dB-Hz). Until then the checks show
their values but can't raise anything, so starting with no signal or a poor antenna logs nothing.
If, once armed, the signal stays below that bar for 5 minutes with no extra noise, the watch
disarms (an antenna or cable problem, not an attack) and waits to arm again. A jammer raises the
noise, so the watch stays armed through it.
Jamming checks:
  - Noise in the band: GNSS signals are under the noise, so with a fixed gain the band's power is
    the noise itself. The receiver learns the band's quiet level and shape in the first 30 s
    (kept as noise-<band>.npz in the data folder, per band and gain) and reports the rise.
    Watch +3 dB, alert +6 dB. Off with automatic gain.
  - Narrowband interference: a peak above the band's usual shape (its own spurs are in the
    baseline): a carrier or swept jammer. Watch 5 dB, alert 12 dB.
  - Overload (samples clipped), signal strength (every satellite's C/N0 falling together) and
    satellites lost at once. A C/N0 drop without more noise is reported as a watch: something
    blocking the antenna - unless it is a stream gap: when the SDR's USB link lost samples
    (the receiver reports it, or every satellite dropped out together and came back at its old
    strength within seconds) the event is marked 'stream gap (SDR/USB) - not RF', the summary
    says so, and the raw samples are kept for the first gap of a session only. The jamming
    card counts the session's gaps ("3 stream gaps this session, last 110 ms at 12:20").
  - A check's level is held once raised until its value has dropped a little below the line
    (1 dB, or 20 %) for the clearing time, so a signal sitting on a threshold no longer flips
    between watch and alert every minute.
Spoofing checks:
  - Position vs home and position drift: the receiver's own fix against Settings > location, and
    how far it moved during the session (measured here: within ~15-25 m normally).
  - Time jump: GPS time against the PC clock, with the PC clock's own steps taken out.
  - Doppler vs orbits: each satellite's Doppler against what its own broadcast orbit says it must
    be from here, after the SDR's frequency offset (common to all). Real satellites matched to
    ~1 Hz rms here; one fake transmitter can't get every satellite right. Alert at 50 Hz off.
  - Satellites heard that their own orbit puts below the horizon, and signals that are too strong
    or all the same strength.
'Relearn quiet noise' forgets the noise baselines (do it when the band is known to be quiet, e.g.
after connecting or changing the antenna): the next 30 s become the new one, at once if receiving.
Event snapshots: whenever a check rises to watch or alert, everything around it is saved in its
own folder, data\integrity\<date-time>-<check>\ (the 'Snapshots' button opens it; double-click
the 'Snapshot saved' line in the event list to view one):
  - event.json: when (local time, weekday), the band and the receiver's settings, the checks and
    satellites at the start and end, which checks rose and how far, and a summary - when it
    really began (worked out from the data, not the check's hold-off), its kind (stream gap,
    interference, signal drop), how long it lasted, how the noise rose and fell (a gradual rise
    and fall is like a jammer in a passing vehicle; an abrupt start, something switched on
    nearby), what kind of signal (narrowband, swept, broadband) and which part of the band, each
    satellite's C/N0 before and at its lowest, who was lost and how soon it came back, the
    position and GPS time during it.
  - lines.txt: every line the receiver sent from 2 minutes before until 90 s after the last
    check cleared (up to 15 minutes): satellites, fixes, noise, the band's spectrum each second.
  - waterfall.png: the band over the event.
  - samples.cs8 + samples.json: the raw SDR samples from 20 s before to 20 s after the start
    (~160 MB; signed 8-bit I/Q at 2.048 MS/s, opens in SDR++ or inspectrum) - to look at the
    interfering signal itself. Only the newest 5 are kept; untick 'Keep raw samples' to skip
    them (they are also skipped when the disk is low).
  Limits, so it can't fill the disk: at most 20 snapshots a day and the newest 200 kept; a
  signal that never goes away (a steady local spur) gets one snapshot, not a new one every
  15 minutes. GLONASS and BeiDou are not watched for now (few satellites with this antenna, and a
  steady spur at 1560.33 MHz next to BeiDou B1I kept raising alerts); WATCH_BANDS in
  app\integrity.py turns them on.
