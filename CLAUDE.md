# Satellite Tracker - notes for Claude

Read this before working on the project. The owner's location, preferences and the personal-data check run before
every push are in `CLAUDE.local.md` beside this file (git-ignored) - read both. Written 2026-11-06 at commit
`7e3bdec` and checked against the code; the code is the source of truth where they disagree.

## What it is
A Windows desktop app (PyQt5 + GNU Radio, bundled Python) that receives satellites with ONE SDR at a time (built and
tested on an RTL-SDR; any gr-osmosdr device works), decodes them, and shows them on a map, globe, sky plot and signal
views. Public repo: this checkout's `origin` (branch `main`, GPL-3.0). Local checkout: `C:\IridiumTracker`.

**Core rule (owner's requirement since 2026-11-01): every position and orbit drawn comes from the owner's own
receptions** - Iridium ring-alert positions + Doppler and Orbcomm's self-reported positions (OEP packets) + Doppler,
both fitted by orbitfit.py; GNSS broadcast ephemerides decoded here; ham Doppler fits. Public TLEs/CelesTrak are for
names, identification, reference facts and comparison in the satellite info window (satinfo.py), and test
validation - **never for drawing a satellite on the map, globe or sky plot**.

**Privacy/law rule**: only technical frames are used. Iridium voice/SBD/paging/data contents and ham frame payloads
are never decoded, shown or stored (console marks VOC/VDA private; `storage.write_reduced` strips ` PAGE(...)`;
`HFR` lines never carry payload bytes). README.txt "PRIVACY AND THE LAW" explains why.

Sections (header buttons): **Tracker** (map/globe/sky/signal views, satellite list, timeline), **Images** (Meteor-M
pictures via SatDump), **Radio** (SDR++-style listening 24 MHz-2.3 GHz), **Integrity** (GNSS jamming/spoofing watch).

## Working rules
- **Push only when the owner says "Yes, push"** (or clearly equivalent).
- Before every push run the personal-data grep in `CLAUDE.local.md` on the staged diff; it must be empty. Never commit
  `data/`, settings, captures, coordinates, names or emails (public repo). **Screenshots from the app show the home
  coordinates** (status bar "You: …", map centred on home) - never commit or attach them.
- Commit messages: short title, body of what/why/how-checked, ending with the `Co-Authored-By:` trailer of the current
  Claude model. Use `git commit -F <file>` (PowerShell quoting broke `-m`).
- Keep `README.txt` (the user guide shipped in the zip) updated with every user-visible feature; `README.md` is the
  GitHub overview, `BUILDING.md` the build notes.
- Style in the tree: plain-language comments that say *why* (often with the measurement behind a constant); British
  spelling in UI text ("colour", "centre" - two buttons still say "Center": globe.py, iridium_tracker.py); nothing may
  take the tracker down (background work catches and logs). New persistent files: write atomically (`.tmp` then
  `os.replace`) as catalog, refpoints/geoid, gnss_rx state/baseline and reduced frames do (settings.json and a few
  others are still written directly).
- Test before claiming: replay recorded data offline, then a live run with the owner. Report measured numbers.
- Only one program can use the SDR. The owner usually has the tracker open and receiving; ask them to press Stop
  rather than killing their processes (killing their receiver from outside was refused by the permission system).
- Network calls the app makes: OSM tiles, CelesTrak (names, `requests`, 15 s timeout), Open-Meteo elevation (sends
  the home lat/lon), Windows Location via PowerShell. Nothing else.

## Hardware it is built around
- SDR: **Nooelec NESDR SMArTee XTR v5** - RTL2832U + **Elonics E4000** tuner (~52-2300 MHz), 0.5 ppm TCXO (PPM 0 is
  correct), **always-on bias tee (~4.5 V)** that powers an active GPS antenna through the coax. WinUSB via Zadig.
- E4000 quirks:
  - **IF gain**: at the driver default the samples sit at ~0.6 % of ADC full scale (under one 8-bit step).
    `--if-gain 60` lifts L-band to ~9-10 % (GPS went from 0-2 satellites at ~33 dB-Hz to 5 at ~37). At 137 MHz with
    gain 40, IF 60 measured *lower* than 50, so Meteor defaults to 50. "Tune gain" (gain_tune.py) measures it.
  - A **DC spike** at the tuned centre. Meteor avoids it in code (tuned 200 kHz below 137.9 MHz), Radio too
    (`RADIO_OFFSET_HZ` 250 kHz). GNSS is tuned exactly on its carrier and relies on the Source panel's **Offset
    tuning** option - which defaults to OFF (`sdr_settings.DEFAULTS['offset_tune']`), is ON in the owner's settings,
    and with it off GNSS lost every satellite. (README.txt wrongly says it is on by default.)
- Antennas used: an **active GPS L1 puck** (3-5 V, bias-tee powered) for all GNSS work (also fine for Iridium);
  telescopic and coil whips for VHF/UHF. GNSS needs open sky: under cover 3-5 GPS satellites at 33-38 dB-Hz;
  outdoors with a clear view 15 satellites for an hour.
- Reference receiver: a **Garmin GPSMAP 64st** handheld (see "Garmin").

## Running, testing, debugging
- Taskbar: the process AppUserModelID is `SatelliteTracker.App`; `taskbar.set_relaunch` also puts relaunch properties
  on the main window (command `python\pythonw.exe -s app\start.py`, `app\icon.ico`), so a pinned button keeps the
  icon and starts the tracker. `start.py` therefore recreates the .bat's environment itself (runtime dirs on PATH,
  QT_PLUGIN_PATH, PYTHONNOUSERSITE, cwd `app\`), only filling in what is missing.
- Startup hang report: `main()` arms `faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(STARTUP_HANG_S` 60 s`)` into
  `data\startup-hang.txt`, cancelled and the file removed once the event loop runs. 2026-11-07, ~4 min after a Fast
  Startup resume: three starts hung windowless, idle, no error; loaded modules stopped at Qt + winmm/wdmaud/AudioSes
  (sound.SoundPlayer's QAudioOutput / Chime's QSoundEffect are the suspects); later starts were fine. The stuck
  copies could not be killed from the assistant's shell - the owner ends them in Task Manager.
- Launch: `Satellite Tracker.bat` (pythonw `app\start.py`), `Satellite Console.bat` (`app\console.py`, a line-by-line
  log of every band except Radio; `--receive --band <key>` receives without the window; `--capture NAME` prints a
  finished capture).
- Bundled runtime `C:\IridiumTracker\python` (git-ignored, ~550 MB, `build\build_runtime.py`, pinned
  `build\environment.yml` incl. `gnuradio-iridium=1!1.0.0`). For anything run by hand use the union of what the two
  .bat files and start.py set:
  ```powershell
  $P='C:\IridiumTracker\python'; $env:PATH="$P;$P\Library\mingw-w64\bin;$P\Library\usr\bin;$P\Library\bin;$P\Scripts;$P\bin;$env:PATH"
  $env:PYTHONNOUSERSITE='1'; $env:OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS='1'; $env:QT_PLUGIN_PATH="$P\Library\plugins"
  cd C:\IridiumTracker\app; & "$P\python.exe" -W error -m py_compile <files>
  ```
  The app itself forces `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1` (start.py, console.py, and Receiver for every child) - otherwise
  OpenBLAS reserves ~2.5 GB on this 20-core PC and trips the 2 GB Iridium memory watchdog; set it by hand too.
  `pocket_trk.exe` needs `python\Library\bin` on PATH (SoapySDR.dll; else STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND, exit 53 / -1073741515).
- Built-in hooks: `start.py --snapshot OUT.png [--at=ISO] [--select=NAME_WITH_UNDERSCORES] [--system=KEY] [--theme=]
  [--map-theme=] [--info] [--windows]`, `--test-receiver=<old .bits>` (replays through the real parser),
  `--start-receiver`.
- **Tests are scratch scripts in `build\_tmp\` (git-ignored)**; no test framework. Patterns:
  - Data isolation: set `IRIDIUM_TRACKER_DATA=<scratch dir>` **before importing any app module** (paths.DATA is read
    at import, and importing `paths` creates `captures\` and moves legacy files from `app\` into DATA). Copy
    `settings.json`, the catalog (`catalog\` folder, or legacy `catalog-data.json`), `*.tle` **and** `*.tle.groups`
    (else CelesTrak is fetched again). Scratch tests `rmtree(argv[1])` - never pass the real `data` folder. Some old
    scratch tests use the real data folder.
  - GUI: `QApplication`, `it.apply_app_colours(app)`, `w = it.Tracker()` (the argument is `replay`, not a parent),
    `w.setAttribute(Qt.WA_DontShowOnScreen)`, `w.show()`, pump `processEvents`, drive it
    (`w.sys_box.setCurrentIndex(w.sys_box.findData('gnss'))`, `w.show_section(3)`, `w.deck.show_view('globe')`), then
    `widget.grab().save(png)` and look at it. **`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` has no fonts** (blank text).
  - Without the SDR: gr-osmosdr file device `file=C:/path/x.cf32,rate=2048000,freq=..,repeat=true,throttle=true`
    (forward slashes; complex64 only). Run receivers directly (`python gnss_rx.py --device file=... --spp-state ...`)
    and read their stdout lines.
  - GNSS offline: pocket_trk's log and RTCM of every run are kept beside the capture as
    `data\captures\<capture>.trk<run>.log` / `.rtcm` (raw files: trimmed with the capture by storage.py; before
    2026-11-06 they went to `%TEMP%\gnss_live_*\`, which gnss_rx now removes after a day). The log holds `$OBS`
    (pseudorange, carrier, Doppler), `$NAV` bits and `$LOG` events; the RTCM holds MSM7 observables. Replay through
    `spp.Solver` directly, or `gnss_rx.Lines` after setting
    `sys.argv = ['gnss_rx.py', ...]` *before* `import gnss_rx` (it parses argv and loads GNU Radio at import) - see
    `build\_tmp\spp_eval.py`, `warm_logs.py`.
  - Raw signal: while gnss1 runs (or gnss_rx by hand with `--snap-trigger FILE`), write an absolute stem path into
    `data\integrity\iq-trigger.txt`; gnss_rx saves up to 20 s before + 20 s after as `<stem>.cs8` (+ `.json`). For
    pocket_trk convert to INT8X2 **with Q negated**.
- Live tests need the SDR free (tracker receiver, SDR++, SatDump closed) and usually the owner outdoors.
- `.bat` files should be CRLF (`.gitattributes eol=crlf`), but the working copies are LF (attribute applies on
  checkout); renormalize before packaging - make_package.py zips the working tree as is. Edit files with the Edit tool
  or Python, not PowerShell `Set-Content` (encoding/quotes get mangled).

## Architecture
```
Tracker window (iridium_tracker.py: Data, MapView, Timeline, Tracker; all on the Qt main thread)
  ├─ receiver.Receiver (QObject) ── starts ONE band's subprocess(es), tails their output, writes
  │    data\captures\<prefix><YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS>.{live,log,start,bits,s16,running}
  │    signals: status, running(bool), decoded, frame(kind,line), gnss_line(kind,line)
  │    after Stop (and detached on window close): catalog.py --ready=<cap>  (Meteor: images.py --decode <cap>);
  │    Radio captures and runs that received <200 bytes are deleted instead
  ├─ Data: catalog.load_data() + every not-yet-catalogued .live file (poll every 2 s) → orbits/fixes/info
  ├─ spectrum/sound via UDP from the receiver (sdr_taps: IRS2 spectrum, IRAU audio; CTRL/TUNE back)
  └─ sections: Images (images_view), Radio (radio_view), Integrity (integrity.IntegrityView)
```
- **Everything runs on the Qt main thread** (catalog load, orbit fits, live parsing, Integrity, CelesTrak refresh) -
  slow work freezes the window. A QThread whose Python object is garbage-collected crashes the app; keep references
  (`source_dialog._SEARCHES`).
- Time model: all views draw the scene at the timeline time `Tracker.t` (live, play, scrub), not the clock.
  `refresh()` must build a new scene dict each time (the globe caches by identity). Satellites hide beyond
  `MAX_SIGMA_KM` 1500 and fade beyond `FAINT_SIGMA_KM` 150.
- Bands (`systems.ORDER`, RADIO kept last by convention) vs display systems (`systems.DISPLAY`: iridium, orbcomm, ham,
  gnss; `band['system']`). `systems.get`/`of_name`/`of_capture` **silently fall back to IRIDIUM**; ham and GNSS names
  have no prefix and must be `systems.register()`ed when loaded. Capture prefixes match with startswith (a new one must
  not prefix another). Per-band settings in `settings.json['sdr']` as `<key>_gain`, `<key>_auto_gain`,
  `<key>_if_gain` (Iridium bare keys) - a new band needs all three in `sdr_settings.DEFAULTS`.

| key | prefix | centre / rate | process | output lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| iridium | `output-` | 1626.5 MHz − rate/2, default 2 MS/s | `sdr_source.py` (runs gr-iridium's extractor via runpy, monkey-patching osmosdr.source / FlowGraph.__init__) → `.bits` → iridium-toolkit `iridium-parser.py` | IRA, ITL, … (RAW/ERR damaged) |
| orbcomm | `orbcomm-` | 137.5 MHz, 1.2288 MS/s | `orbcomm_rx.py` (vendored fbieberly decoder) | OEP OSY OPK OBAD |
| ham2m / ham70 | `ham2m-`/`ham70-` | 145.55 MHz 2.048 / 436.725 MHz 2.4 | `ham_rx.py` (channelizer + gr-satellites) | HFR HSIG |
| gnss1 | `gnss-` | 1575.42 MHz, 2.048 MS/s | `gnss_rx.py` (GPS L1C/A + Galileo E1B + WAAS) | GCH GEPH GPOS GSPP GGAP GLOG (+GTIME GNOISE GSPEC) |
| glo1 | `glo-` | 1602 MHz, 2.4 MS/s | `gnss_rx.py --constellation glonass` (~5 of 14 channels fit) | GCH GEPH GPOS (+GTIME GNOISE GSPEC) |
| bds1 | `bds-` | 1561.098 MHz, 2.048 MS/s | `gnss_rx.py --constellation beidou` (B1I) | GCH GEPH GPOS (+GTIME GNOISE GSPEC) |
| meteor | `meteor-` | 137.7 MHz, 1.024 MS/s | `meteor_rx.py` → `.s16` 256 kS/s → SatDump | MSIG |
| radio | `radio-` | anywhere, 2.048 MS/s | `radio_rx.py` (spectrum + sound only) | - |

- **Iridium timing lives in the GUI process**: Receiver reads `.bits` every 250 ms, pipes RAW lines into the parser,
  and writes `.start` (the earliest now − burst ms) - the only time base for bursts (`catalog.capture_start`); replay
  mode doesn't write it. sdr_source.py uses gr-iridium private attributes (`_center_frequency`, `_input_sample_rate`) -
  pinned version matters. Never run the extractor below 14 dB threshold (memory flood crashed the PC once);
  `iq_correction` stays off (mirror bursts).
- **A line format is parsed in five places**; a new/changed kind must be handled in all that apply:
  `receiver._orbcomm_output` regex/filters, `catalog.read_*`/`analyze_*`, the tracker's own live parsers
  (`Data._read_live`, `_read_live_orbcomm`, `_read_live_ham`, `_read_live_gnss`), console.py's describers, and
  `integrity.Monitor.line` (GGAP/GLOG were added to all of them on 2026-11-06 - follow that diff for the next kind). Plus `systems.*['keep_kinds']` to survive in reduced files, and `receiver.DAMAGED` if it
  is a failure. GTIME/GNOISE/GSPEC are never saved and reach Integrity only through the tracker's own Receiver
  signals (if the Console receives, Integrity sees nothing).
- Receivers are stopped with `taskkill /T /F` - **their shutdown code never runs**; anything they must keep is written
  atomically while running (gnss-solver.json at most once a minute, noise baseline, IQ snapshots). Every band
  receiver except `sdr_source.py` takes `--parent-pid` and exits when the program that started it dies. The
  `.running` marker (PID) is the SDR lock checked by tracker, console and Tune gain.
- **Catalog** (`catalog.py`, runs after each Stop): analyses each finished capture **once** into
  `data\catalog\<capture>.json` + `index.json` (since 2026-11-06; if `index.json` is missing it falls back to the
  legacy `catalog-data.json` / `.previous.json`; an unreadable index falls back to globbing the folder). Results are
  frozen: changing an analyser does nothing until `catalog.py --redo` (which keeps old results for captures whose files
  are gone; the tracker runs a full redo when home moves > 2 km). After 7 days / 1 GB `storage.py` leaves only
  `.frames.gz` (the `keep_kinds` lines of the time). `save_data` writes only changed files atomically, **deletes
  only the entries it loaded and that were dropped from the dict it is given** (never by glob), merges the on-disk
  index names in, and rewrites `index.json` (the tracker reloads on its mtime). Runs take `catalog\.lock` (PID; a
  second run waits up to 60 s, a stale lock is removed). One capture's failure writes a stub entry with an `error`
  key (re-analysed by `--redo`) and the traceback to `tracker-error.log`; GNSS lines are converted per line
  (`counts['bad']`), so one cut line can no longer wedge the catalog.
  - History: on 2026-11-05 an interrupted save truncated the old 11 MB single file; the tracker silently showed no
    history and every catalog run crashed. Recovered (56 complete entries + re-analysis); `data\
    catalog-data.truncated-20261105.json` is the damaged original. The per-capture layout is the fix.
- Orbits: Iridium/Orbcomm `orbitfit.fit` (circular + J2, fixes + Doppler); in iridium_tracker.py `IRIDIUM_FLOOR_KM` 12
  + `IRIDIUM_DRIFT_KM_H` 2.5 and `FIT_DAYS` 7 (latest week). Ham `orbitfit.fit_doppler` (needs passes on 2+ orbits,
  scaled to 436.5 MHz). GNSS `gnss.EphemerisOrbit` / `SBASOrbit` / `GlonassOrbit` from decoded broadcast
  ephemerides. `Data.fit_orbits` wraps each `_fit_one` so one bad fit records "orbit fit failed" in `no_orbit` (the
  plane-direction retry pass is not wrapped). `fit_orbits` does nothing while there is no home location.

## GNSS in depth (gnss_rx.py, gnss.py, rtcm3.py, spp.py, posquality.py)
- Decoder: **PocketSDR `pocket_trk.exe`** (T. Takasu, BSD-2) in `app\pocketsdr\`. Live mode: samples → int8 IQ
  (`Quantizer`, noise scaled to ~±24) → Windows named pipe → one long-running pocket_trk (restarted if it exits); its
  `-log` and `-rtcm` files are tailed. **Q is negated** in `Quantizer` (pocket_trk's IQ convention is gr-osmosdr's
  mirror; without it every Doppler has the wrong sign). Orbits come only from the RTCM output (its `$EPH` log lines are
  masked) - keep `-rtcm`. RTCM decoded: 1019 GPS, 1045/1046 Galileo, 1042 BeiDou (BDT = GPST − 14 s, week+1356), 1020
  GLONASS. Chunks mode (`--mode chunks`) is an old fallback.
- pocket_trk options file: `-opt FILE`, lines `name = value` (every key with its default: sdr_rcv.c `sdr_rcv_setopt`;
  a source copy matching the shipped 0.21 binary is in `C:\Users\tucke\it_h\`). The app passes `data\pocket_trk.opt`
  if it exists (live mode only) and logs the command and options into the capture .log. **Shipped since 2026-11-06:
  `lost_th = 10` and `b_dll = 0.5`** (measured on recordings: the default `lost_th` 4 gave the phase loop one second
  after the FLL pull-in, so 55 % of the satellites found at 34-36 dB-Hz were dropped at exactly 2.0 s with the signal
  still there; the default `b_dll` 0.25 Hz lost every Galileo E1B lock in ~10 s at 2 samples per chip - Galileo's
  missing orbits were the DLL, not weak signal). Lowering `thres_cn0_l` alone finds weak satellites but ≤32 locks
  noise; `t_acq 0.04`, `bump_jump`, E1C pilot channels and notching the receiver's +22 dB spur at 1020 kHz changed
  nothing; `fast_acq` needs a fix first and only adds below-horizon skipping. Replay at `-tscale 1`: faster replays
  starve the one-channel-at-a-time search. pocket_trk runs are not repeatable (search timing varies) - compare
  settings over several runs. Evidence: `build\_tmp\review-20261106\GNSS-review.md`.
- **Sample-stream gaps**: the RTL-SDR/USB path loses 100-140 ms a few times a day (never a buffer's worth, no overflow
  message anywhere). Left as a cut, every satellite is lost and a loss ≥ ~90 ms puts every GPS range below pocket_trk's
  accepted window for the rest of the run (it re-aligns its clock only when it has a fix). Since 2026-11-06 gnss_rx
  detects a gap from the arrival times (a steady ≥20 ms excess over 60 ms of blocks; a scheduling stall decays and is
  told apart), feeds that many zero samples (locks survive - proven on a recording), writes `GGAP: t ms source` and
  counts gaps in the status line. **Since 2026-11-07 only after a signal check** (`LiveTracker.check_gap`): every
  'gap' logged 11-06 evening to 11-07 (37-62 ms, up to 52 in 85 min) was blocks arriving late with nothing lost - the
  code phase of G09/G16/G31 ran on unbroken through them in Integrity's raw recordings, the wall clock never stepped
  (`build\_tmp\gapcheck\`: codephase.py, clockwatch.py) - and the zeros shifted pocket_trk's timeline: every lock
  lost 5 s later, then 'clock lost' and a restart, every few minutes. Replays (gnss_bench, new `ins:T:MS`): 45.3 ms of
  zeros into an unbroken stream lost all 4 locks; a real 100.37 ms cut unfilled lost all 4; the same cut filled with
  exactly that many zeros kept all 4 (48.0 ms inserted survives only because it is whole code periods). The check
  compares the code phase of up to 3 GPS satellites >= 33 dB-Hz (from the newest GCH, `CH`; the satellite sits at
  MINUS pocket_trk's Doppler in the Q-negated stream) in 20 ms ending 25 ms before and starting 25 ms after the
  suspected gap (a 0.5 s ring of the fed samples): unmoved (<= 2 samples) -> nothing filled, the late timing becomes
  the baseline; moved by -n (mod 2048) on a majority -> filled with the size measured from the code (to the sample;
  the arrival-time estimate was 44 samples off in the test); no strong satellite / disagreement -> not filled
  (logged). ~20 ms of CPU in the sample thread, only when the detector fires. Tests: `build\_tmp\gapcheck\
  test_gap.py` (real samples, simulated arrival times), `week1\rx\test_rx.py` (fill mechanics, check stubbed).
  The cause of the late arrivals is not known (not the clock; GIL/scheduling suspected).
  **The SDR dropping off USB** (Windows Kernel-PnP 1010 'surprise removed': 13 times 11-04..11-07, at 11-07 11:48 with
  the USB headset dongle and another device on the same hub) left the receiver with no samples for hours. Now
  gnss_rx exits with 'GNSS: SDR LOST' after `SDR_SILENT_S` 10 s without samples (exit 3, the flowgraph is not
  waited for), and `receiver.SDR_LOST` (librtlsdr's 'rtlsdr_read_async returned' / 'cb transfer status: 5', seen only
  at real losses, or 'SDR LOST') stops the capture and reopens the same band every `REOPEN_EVERY_S` 10 s, up to
  `REOPEN_TRIES` 30; Start or Stop by hand ends the waiting (`build\_tmp\gapcheck\test_reopen.py`). A watchdog
  restarts pocket_trk when 'PSEUDORANGE OUT OF RANGE' arrives for GPS
  satellites 20 times in 10 s (`GLOG: t RESTART clock-lost`), after 5 min without a fix with 5+ synced satellites, or
  when the log reader dies. pocket_trk's own events go out as `GLOG` (FOUND/LOST/FALSELOCK/EPOCH/SYNC/START/RESTART).
- Lines emitted (exact formats in `Lines` / `NoiseMeter`):
  `GCH: t sat sig cn0 dop lock [sync nav err lol]`, `GEPH: t sat <fields|GLO,…|SBAS,…>`, `GPOS: t lat lon h nsat`,
  `GSPP: t lat lon h nsat hdop n_waas_iono n_fast n_longterm n_smoothed prior`, `GTIME: t offset_s nsat spread`,
  `GNOISE: t power rise clip peak peak_mhz floor learning rms_pct`, `GSPEC: t f_lo f_hi v1..v128`.
  **GSPP field order is a contract** with catalog.analyze_gnss and iridium_tracker._read_live_gnss, which both read
  n_smoothed as f[8] (< 4 ⇒ `quick` fix, excluded from accuracy) and `prior` as f[9] (1 ⇒ the height row held it:
  `fx['prior']`, its height left out of posquality's height figures; lines before 2026-11-07 have no f[9]) - change
  together. `catalog.read_gnss` drops kind + t (fields shift by 2); `integrity.Monitor.line` indexes the full split.
- Timing/clock: the stream's start time = sliding 10 s minimum of (arrival − samples so far/rate) − `usb_latency()`;
  each sample's PC time = that + its sample number/rate (re-anchored after dropped samples). `usb_latency` = two USB
  buffers + 5 ms for RTL-SDR (133 ms with default buffers; 0 for other devices). GTIME = GPS − PC, verified against
  NTP to ~2 ms. The owner's PC clock ran ~0.75 s behind; Settings > PC clock sets it (elevated `Set-Date -Adjust`).
- WAAS satellites S31/S33/S35 = PRN 131/133/135 (strongest signals, 34-42 dB-Hz). They give no position themselves;
  type 9 gives the GEO's own position (for the map); types 1/2-5/24/25/18/26 are corrections used by spp.py.
- GLONASS: FDMA, only the middle channels fit 2.4 MS/s; a channel's `$CH` lines are dropped until its slot has been
  decoded, then carry the slot name. BeiDou B1I: pocket_trk's channel PRNs are unreliable (its C38 carried C43's
  orbit) - `BeidouNames` names each by its decoded orbit vs the nearest catalog satellite (≤300 km), holding lines
  until then. A steady spur at ~1560.33 MHz sits near B1I.
- Galileo: with pocket_trk's default DLL bandwidth 98 % of E1B locks died within 20 s (the orbit needs ~30 s of
  unbroken frames), so its orbits rarely decoded; `b_dll = 0.5` in `pocket_trk.opt` held them in replay (live
  confirmation pending; live 11-06 evening: all four Galileo satellites held, 2600+ ranges per 14 min). Two Galileo
  satellites with orbits get their own clock unknown in spp.py; a lone one rides on the GPS clock (+1 m sigma) while
  the height prior is on. GLONASS/BeiDou can't be received with GPS (the SDR sees ~2 MHz).
- **Own solver `spp.py`** (GSPP lines, GPS band only): pocket_trk `$OBS` (P, L, D, C/N0) → broadcast orbit/clock, TGD
  (Galileo: BGD(E1,E5b)), Sagnac, Saastamoinen troposphere, ionosphere from the WAAS grid (MT18/26, pierce point
  350 km, 5° grid; bilinear with 4 corners, DO-229 triangle with 3) else Klobuchar (decoded from GPS subframe 4
  page 18) → weighted LSQ (one clock per system, elevation mask 10°, drops up to 2 outliers when redundancy allows).
  WAAS fast (PRC) + long-term corrections (IODE must match). Weights: 'simple' (noise by smoothing count and
  elevation) - an error-budget option (`weights='budget'`: UDRE / URA / SISA / GIVE / troposphere) measured worse
  (it down-weights good Galileo ranges) and is kept only for experiments.
  **Static mode (week 2, 2026-11-07):** `Solver.set_prior(h, lat, lon)` adds a height row (sigma 3 m) while the
  solution stays within 1 km of where the height was learned; then 3 satellites give a quick fix, 4 give an 'ok' one
  with HDOP computed from the augmented geometry (gate still 6), a lone Galileo joins. With 5+ satellites the epoch is
  also solved without the row (`h_free`, `vdop_free`, `ok_free`) for checking and learning. `gnss_rx.HeightPrior`
  owns the height: from `gnss-solver.json['height']` ({h, lat, lon, n, t}), the first time from the catalog's
  WAAS session middles (2+ agreeing); learned from prior-free 5+-satellite fixes with VDOP ≤ 8 (5-satellite VDOP is
  5-6.5 from this site), each minute weighted by geometry; a brand-new prior needs 15 min of them; dropped when a
  5-minute median of them disagrees by more than max(9 m, 3.75 × VDOP). Replays (`build\_tmp\week2\
  replay_static.py`; prior from OTHER sessions): 04:33 first 100 min good fixes 2914/5083 epochs → 5920/5979, R95
  5.5 → 4.7 m; 03:29 R95 3.8 → 3.4 m; 20:54 (Galileo-heavy) 6.4 → 3.5 m. A deliberately 30 m wrong prior was
  dropped after 6 min (`test_lines_prior.py`, PRIOR_TEST=wrong).
  **Carrier smoothing**: Hatch filter, 100 s; pocket_trk's code−carrier difference has a common per-epoch term
  (receiver clock steering, +16.7 m/s and 1 ms steps) removed with the median across satellites.
  **SETTLE_S = 30**: a satellite's smoothing starts 30 s after its first pseudorange (restarts after a cycle slip
  ≥8 m, a zero carrier phase or one missed epoch); the code loop is still pulling in - without it a side-by-side test
  against the Garmin showed 11 m and −31 m errors. Fix gate: HDOP ≤ 6 and ≥4 satellites smoothed ≥30 s; before that
  "quick" fixes (residual rms < 15 m; 3 satellites + the height prior are only ever quick).
  - Measured (8-9 recorded sessions): 95 % radius 3-16 m vs pocket_trk 11-32 m; half within 1-4 m vs 4-9 m; session
    middles agree to 1.4 m rms horizontally / 5.3 m height vs pocket_trk 2.4 / 8.5. With smoothing and WAAS off it
    reproduces pocket_trk (validates the maths). Live outdoor hour (2026-11-06): ±3 m per fix, 10-min average
    ±1.9 m, 2.6 m from home; pocket_trk ±12 m.
- Warm start: `data\gnss-solver.json` keeps GPS's ionosphere model and the newest decoded orbit of each GPS/Galileo
  satellite (orbits older than 7 days dropped at load; the ionosphere model too if the file is older than 7 days). The
  solver starts with saved orbits whose toe is within 4 h → first (quick) fix 4-11 s before pocket_trk's own; most
  start-up time is pocket_trk acquiring/syncing. `--narrow-search` (only satellites predicted up) exists but is
  **off**: on a recording it locked 4-5 satellites vs 6 with the full list (pocket_trk searches all in parallel).
- `posquality.py` (the "Your position" panel, Navigation view): per-fix R95/CEP50 over 10 min; average uncertainty =
  2.45·σ/√n_eff with n_eff = span/(2τ), τ floored per source (`TAU_FLOOR_S`: own solver 240 s, pocket_trk 30 s;
  measured correlation ~51 s / ~9 s) and combined with half the window's drift (since 2026-11-07: against the Garmin
  point the own solver's claim held 85 % of windows, was 66 %; pocket_trk's 5.8 m claim still 99 %, was a 10.3 m one).
  Fixes flagged `prior` count horizontally but not in the height figures. Needs ≥5 min; `long_term()` = every
  session's middle (split at 10-min gaps, weighted by effective length), uncertainty from how much sessions disagree
  × Student t (`t975`), shown in the headline from `LT_MIN_SESSIONS` 4 on. Distances shown to a ★ reference point (or
  one named "antenna"), else home ("from home (no reference starred)"). Reference points (refpoints.py): a Garmin
  stretch is imported only when `good_stretch` (60+ points at ≥ 0.5/s and 95 % within 10 m: 2 of the 39 old ones
  pass); `auto_star` stars the tightest one (300+ points within 25 m of home) when nothing is starred; Garmin heights
  are tagged `height_source: barometer` and shown as such; `still_stretches` is linear now (1.2 s → 16 ms). Also "Up but not heard" (G/E satellites ≥15° up by their own
  orbit but not tracked - a long list means the sky view is blocked), start-up history, sea-level heights.
  `headline`/`details` read keys the caller sets (`source`, `ref`, `ref_m`, `long`, `pocket_r95_m`, `geoid_sep`).
- Session stats (`catalog.session_stats`): kept for every GNSS capture, used (start-up history) and backfilled for
  gnss1 ones: first-fix times (pocket_trk and own solver), fixes, satellites, C/N0 median, middle + accuracy.

## Integrity section (integrity.py) - jamming/spoofing watch
- Watches **GPS L1 only** (`WATCH_BANDS = ('gnss1',)`; the BeiDou spur kept alerting; its module docstring still says
  all GNSS bands). gnss_rx's `NoiseMeter` learns the quiet band (30 s, per band and gain, `data\noise-<key>.npz`;
  deleting the file relearns live) and reports band power rise and narrowband peaks (FFTs at **random offsets** -
  fixed offsets made a 1-2 ms sweep look like a carrier).
- Checks: jam - noise rise (3/6 dB), narrowband peak (5/12 dB), clipping, all-satellite C/N0 drop, lock loss; spoof -
  position vs home (250/1500 m) and drift, GPS-time jumps (PC clock steps removed via time.monotonic), **Doppler vs
  each non-WAAS satellite's own orbit** (after the median offset, ~+654 Hz on this SDR; needs ≥3 with orbits; off by
  50 Hz flags; alert when ≥2 and ≥half are off; real satellites match to 1-1.5 Hz rms), below-horizon satellites, too
  strong / too even. Hold-off 3 s raise / 20 s clear.
- **Arming**: nothing is raised until ≥4 satellites at median ≥33 dB-Hz for 2 min with the band at its quiet level;
  disarms after 5 min of poor signal without extra noise (antenna/cable problem, not an attack).
- Snapshots per event in `data\integrity\<time>-<check>\`: `event.json` (summary: duration, rise/fall shape -
  gradual both ways ⇒ "moving source", signal kind/where in band, per-satellite C/N0 drop), `lines.txt` (2 min before
  → 90 s after, ≤15 min), `waterfall.png`, raw `samples.cs8` ±20 s (~160 MB, newest 5). Limits: 20 per day, newest
  200, one per stuck signal. Event list `data\integrity-events.jsonl`.

## Garmin GPSMAP 64st (reference receiver)
- MediaTek GPS+GLONASS chip, WAAS capable, **no Galileo or BeiDou**, barometric altimeter. Fixes in < 40 s after power
  on because its chip keeps last position, time and self-made orbit predictions (`Garmin\GPS\BEE.BIN`/`ARC.BIN`,
  `MT.NVM`) - the idea behind our warm start.
- **Live over USB** (`app\garmin_usb.py`, ctypes SetupAPI/DeviceIoControl, Garmin USB protocol - no Spanner program
  needed): needs Garmin's USB driver, the unit's Interface = Garmin Spanner (or Serial) and **"No"** to its
  mass-storage prompt. Gives PVT (D800: position, ellipsoid + sea-level height, EPE/EPH/EPV, fix type incl. WAAS, GPS
  time) and satellite records (prn, SNR, elevation, azimuth, status bits 1 eph / 2 WAAS / 4 used). No ephemerides, no
  raw ranges. `python garmin_usb.py [seconds]` prints; `python garmin_usb.py log FILE` records and reconnects across
  power cycles (`GSTATE`/`GPVT`/`GSATS` lines) and saves the geoid separation to `data\geoid.json`. Only one program
  can open the device.
- **As a drive** ("Yes" to mass storage): GPX 1.1 in `Garmin\GPX` (`Current\Current.gpx`, `Archive\`, daily
  `Waypoints_*.gpx`), settings profiles as XML (`Garmin\Profiles\*.gpf` - satellite system and WAAS switches are NOT in
  them), `.Position.gpx` last position, SQLite R-tree geocache DB. Every 30 s the tracker checks for a Garmin drive;
  when its GPX files changed it copies them to `data\garmin\<unit id>\` and turns waypoints and still stretches
  (< 30 m from their middle for ≥3 min, no gap ≥60 s), both within 500 m of home, into reference points
  (`data\references.json`).
- Findings: side by side outdoors the Garmin's 10-min average was 1.5 m from the home setting (home is accurate); the
  local geoid separation is in `data\geoid.json`; indoors it tracked 7 GPS (incl. G23/G27 the SDR missed) but no
  GLONASS and no WAAS. Earlier 13-18 m disagreements were the Garmin indoors elsewhere. A Garmin on top of the GPS puck
  blocks it.

## Other bands - facts that matter
- Iridium carrier is 1626.1 MHz in `catalog.match_doppler` but 1626.0 in `orbitfit.CARRIER`.
- Orbcomm rate must be a multiple of 38 400 in code (comments say 9600). Orbcomm satellites are named by the nearest
  TLE within 300 km of their own reported position (names only).
- Meteor: `meteor_rx` rate/4 must equal `images.BASEBAND_RATE` (256 kS/s). The 2026-11-05 pass got no signal
  (antenna suspected). Meteor on the map from its own measured Doppler is agreed but waits for a successful pass.
- `systems.of_frequency(137.7 MHz)` resolves to ORBCOMM (first match) - sound/spectrum fall back to it.

## Data folder (`data\`, git-ignored; override with IRIDIUM_TRACKER_DATA)
`settings.json` (home, sdr, storage, audio, images, ui), `catalog\` (+ `index.json`), legacy `catalog-data.json` /
`.previous.json` (read only if `catalog\index.json` is missing - editing them does nothing) and
`catalog-data.truncated-20261105.json`, `catalog.txt`, `captures\`, `tiles\`, `*-names.tle(.groups)`, `sdr.conf`,
`gnss-solver.json`, `noise-<key>.npz`, `integrity\` (+ `iq-trigger.txt`), `integrity-events.jsonl`,
`references.json`, `geoid.json`, `garmin\`, `images\`, `new-satellite.wav`, `tracker-error.log`,
`pocket_trk.opt` (written on first GNSS start if missing), `pocketsdr\<band>\` (pocket_trk's working folder),
`gnss-height-reset.txt` (a pending height-prior reset), `rinex\` (trk2rinex output).

## Known issues / stale text (fix when touching nearby)
- The tracker's storage protection (`_housekeeping`, `show_settings` in iridium_tracker.py) hard-codes the Iridium
  prefix (`'output-%s' % self.receiver.stamp`) - a running non-Iridium capture isn't protected; use `receiver.capname`.
- Messages still say "run 2-decode.bat" (iridium_tracker.py, receiver.py); the iridium_tracker docstring mentions
  `3-tracker.bat`/`1-receive.bat` and catalog-data.json; catalog.py, paths.py, BUILDING.md and the `Data` docstring
  name `catalog-data.json`; BUILDING.md's layout table lacks the GNSS/integrity/Garmin modules; README.txt still says
  `app\settings.json`/`app\tracker-error.log` (now in `data\`), "BeiDou is not received" in one place, offset tuning
  "on by default", and YOUR DATA lists catalog-data.json; README.md says GNSS uses "3-minute IQ pieces" (live pipe is
  the default); console help says keys 1-7 and omits `bds1`; refpoints docstring says "nearest" (the tracker uses ★ /
  "antenna"); gpxio.py refers to a non-existent `geoid.py` (it's refpoints.py); integrity.py's docstring says all GNSS
  bands; `sdr_settings` points at BUILDING.md for IF gain notes that aren't there; `dist\` holds an old
  `IridiumTracker.zip` (make_package writes `SatelliteTracker.zip`).

## History (main milestones, newest first)
- after-batch (2026-11-07): almanac/UTC (nav_bits, GALM), ephemeris archive, catalog C/N0 + sky Signal map +

## Work remaining (hand-over written 2026-11-06 after "week 1"; read this first if you continue the GNSS work)
Everything below comes from the GNSS review of 2026-11-06. Its full report with the measurements is
`build\_tmp\review-20261106\GNSS-review.md` (local, git-ignored: on the owner's PC only) and every number has a
scratch script next to it in `build\_tmp\review-20261106\<area>\`; the week-1 tests are in `build\_tmp\week1\`.
The owner works through "weeks": week 1 is on `main` (ec6da30, 385ab70, 73fabfc). The owner is a beginner; explain
in plain words, test offline first, then a live run with them, report measured numbers. Large multi-agent workflows
hit the account's usage limit twice during the review - keep to about 10 agents per 5-hour window and let agents
write results to `build\_tmp\` so a cut-off loses nothing.

**Status 2026-11-07, the "After" batch (items 5-code, 6-11 and the small things; offline-tested, NOT yet live):**
four helpers + the lead; scratch tests and outputs in `build\_tmp\later\{orbits,sky,garmin,rinex,mine}\`.
- New line kinds **GALM** (almanac / UTC / GGTO facts) and **GHEARD** (`t sat cn0 dop el ratio`: a GPS satellite up
  but not locked, found by our own search) - registered in receiver's filter, `systems` keep_kinds, catalog, tracker,
  console. Neither is ever drawn as a position or an orbit.
- **Item 6 DONE** (`app/nav_bits.py`): GPS almanac/health/UTC, Galileo words 5-10 + GGTO, SBAS MT17 from `$NAV`;
  `gnss-solver.json` keeps 'alm' (28 days), 'utc', 'ggto'. Almanac vs ephemeris: GPS 1-2 km within 3 days, ~8 km at
  6 days; Galileo 1.5 km fresh. Used by 'Up but not heard' (labelled "(almanac)"), `visible_prns` (full sets drop
  PRNs not in the constellation) and satinfo's next pass. Leap seconds from the decoded UTC (`gnss.leap_seconds`,
  table fallback); `rtcm3._full_week`/`_near` resolve the week nearest now (old code was a week or ~20 years off in
  5 of 6 synthetic boundary cases); `fit` 0 -> 4 h; URA/SISA metres in `info['accuracy_m']`; Galileo E1B health
  split from E5b. Not done: WAAS MT9 URA, the sky view's expected ring, almanacs into pocket_trk's navdata file;
  pocket_trk's own navdata file gets almanac af0 wrong (reads the 3 LSBs as MSBs).
- **Item 7 DONE**: catalog `eph_archive` per capture (dedupe IODE+toe), `gnss.MultiEphemerisOrbit` /
  `MultiSBASOrbit` / `MultiGlonassOrbit` pick the nearest toe per sample (subclasses: isinstance checks still
  hold). A day back the newest ephemeris was GPS 0.5 km / WAAS 8-16 km / GLONASS 33-50 Mm off; the archive is exact.
- **Item 8 DONE** (`garmin_usb.py` comparison + `Beside`; receiver `garmin_check()` every 30 s starts
  `garmin_usb.py log <stem>.garmin --parent-pid` while a GNSS band runs and a Spanner-mode unit is present; catalog
  `cap['garmin']`; one position-panel line). Truth only with 3D+WAAS and EPH <= 5 m; horizontal only; Garmin SNR
  never compared. Matches the review's compare.py on the 015121 pair (G23 held by the Garmin, never by us).
- **Item 9 DONE**: passes keep C/N0 1 Hz (`'cn0': {'t0','v'}` half-dB ints, -k = k missing s) and Doppler every 10 s
  with `doppler_n` weights (26.4 -> 10.0 MB on 50 sessions); session `skymap` (5 deg cells, own orbits only) and
  `lock` (GPS, elevation x sector); per-pass `scint` (S4-like from 1 Hz C/N0; noise floor 0.05-0.12 by C/N0). Sky
  window Signal button + summary (weakest direction: W, 33 vs 38 dB-Hz; GPS above 20 deg to the W locked 0-21 %);
  satinfo Signal tab. `app/acqdetect.py --serve` (idle priority, ~0.02 core) searches 1 s a minute for untracked
  GPS above 5 deg: 113/113 tracked found, 0/453 below-horizon false finds (threshold ratio 3.0 ~ 24 dB-Hz); it
  takes samples in gr-osmosdr's IQ convention (NOT Q-negated). `--no-heard` turns it off. **The real catalog needs one
  `catalog.py --redo`** (the owner's; skips captures whose .live changed in the last 20 s).
  Finding to raise with the owner: in Integrity 'lock' events the satellites pocket_trk had just dropped were still
  there at 35-39 dB-Hz - those alerts are pocket_trk losing lock, not the signal going.
- **Item 10 DONE** (`app/rtcm_msm.py`, `app/rinex.py`, `tools/trk2rinex.py` -> `data\rinex\<capture>\`;
  README "PRECISE ANTENNA POSITION"). MSM7 equals `$OBS` to <1 mm / 1 mcycle. **The item's caveats were partly
  wrong:** pocket_trk does not steer the code (code-carrier grows a steady +16.7 m/s = the tuner ~88 Hz off); the
  -1180 m steps and lock-time resets are the MSM encoder re-anchoring phase to code by whole cycles (repaired);
  'PVT EPOCH ADJUSTED' shifts only the code by 20/40/60 ms of light (carrier and Doppler are moved onto the code
  clock, LLI set); Doppler is too noisy for slips (0.6 cycle rms) - slips from the third difference of phase with
  the common part removed; Galileo MSM7 carries 2-4 satellites now (`--galileo`, off by default). RTKLIB / CSRS-PPP
  not run (not installed; an upload is the owner's call).
- **Item 11**: DONE `build\tools\gnss_bench.py` (pocket_trk N times at -tscale 1 on a .cs8, --perturb cut/zero/spur,
  --opt; on the 40 s file pocket_trk's defaults dropped 43 % of new locks within 2.5 s in one run, 0 in another) and
  `build\tests\spp_replay.py` (all captures with .trkN files, --git REV, --prior other; HEAD == now on 4 sessions,
  R95 3.7-4.7 m). The iq-trigger takes 'STEM SECONDS' (<= 900 s) for a long regression recording - still to record
  (5 min outdoors with a full navigation sync). `app/gnss_lines.py` holds the GSPP/GPOS formats (gnss_rx writes,
  catalog + tracker read through it); NOT done: moving console/Integrity/GCH readers onto it, the shared bit/CRC
  helpers (gnss.py, spp.py, gnss_rx.py, rtcm3.py, nav_bits.py, rtcm_msm.py), splitting integrity's Monitor.
- **Item 5 code side DONE, A/B not run**: Stop on a GNSS band writes `<stem>.stop`; gnss_rx closes the pipe, waits
  up to 3 s for pocket_trk to exit (so it saves `.pocket_navdata.csv`), the receiver kills the tree after 4 s.
  pocket_trk runs in `data\pocketsdr\<band>\` (`--pocket-dir`; first time seeded from app\pocketsdr). WAAS PRN
  138 dropped from SIGNALS. `settings.json['sdr']['gnss1_rate']` (0 = 2.048 MS/s; 2400000 for the A/B, no UI;
  the noise baseline relearns because its key holds the rate). Galileo PRNs left as they are (no reliable list of
  non-transmitting ones here). `fast_acq` / `el_mask` untouched.
- Small things DONE: Galileo tracked gate 10 s at 30 dB-Hz (`GNSS_TRACK_BY_SYSTEM`); Integrity says "blocked, or a
  stream gap - checking" for the first GAP_REACQ_S + 5 s of an all-satellite drop; Settings > Location "Forget the
  learned height" (writes `data\gnss-height-reset.txt`; gnss_rx's HeightPrior acts within a second or at start, and
  only sessions after the reset may re-seed it from the catalog); a fresh install gets `data\pocket_trk.opt` with the
  two measured values (receiver.POCKET_TRK_OPT, never over an existing file).
- **Live checks to do with the owner** (one GNSS L1 hour outdoors): GALM lines and 'alm'/'utc' in gnss-solver.json;
  GHEARD lines and the dashed rings; Stop takes ~1-4 s and `data\pocketsdr\gnss1\.pocket_navdata.csv` updates;
  the Garmin line with the unit in Spanner mode (GPS+GLONASS, WAAS on); then `catalog.py --redo` and the sky Signal
  layer; trk2rinex on that capture. Item 2 stays deferred until a live log shows 'RESTART clock-lost' with fixes
  still missing.

**State after week 1 (verified live on capture gnss-20261106-203728):** `data\pocket_trk.opt` (`lost_th = 10`,
`b_dll = 0.5`) is loaded and logged, warm start restored 10 orbits, first own fix 48 s, 10 satellites incl. two
Galileo locked. **Still to verify live:** Galileo lock durations over an hour (were 98 % under 20 s), a real stream
gap (look for `GGAP` lines / `STREAM GAP` events and whether locks survive), the watchdog restart (`GLOG ... RESTART`),
Integrity classifying a gap as "stream gap (SDR/USB) - not RF". The offline end-to-end run script
`build\_tmp\week1\rx\test_e2e.py` (gnss_rx on the 40 s recording through the file device, no SDR) could not be
launched by the sandboxed assistant; the owner can run it. `data\pocket_trk.opt` lives in `data\` (not in git): a
fresh install has none - since 2026-11-07 the receiver writes the two measured defaults when it is missing.

**Week 2 - availability and accuracy** (status 2026-11-07: item 1 DONE - static mode as described under "Own solver",
with these changes from the plan: the error-budget weighting was built but measured worse, so 'simple' weights stay;
the outlier rule was already at redundancy 2 and now benefits from the height row; the prior's VDOP limit is 8, not
4 (5-satellite VDOP is 5-6.5 here). Item 3 DONE (posquality floors/drift/t-factor, good_stretch, auto_star, barometer
tag, linear still_stretches, atomic GPX copy). Item 2 NOT DONE on purpose: with zero-fill and the watchdog the case
it covers (pocket_trk's PVT dead for hours) should not recur - build it only if a live log shows 'RESTART
clock-lost' happening and fixes still missing. Item 4 DONE (its own note below). Item 5 waits for an hour of live
Galileo data. Live confirmation of item 1 pending: look for 'height prior' lines in the capture .log and the
`prior` flag in GSPP lines.)
1. **Static mode in spp.py** (the biggest gain: replays took good own-solver epochs from 1723 to 3987 of 4043 on
   the 11-06 live log at the same 1.5-2.5 m; prototype and replay harness in
   `build\_tmp\review-20261106\spp-solver\` - `sppx.py`, `replay.py`, `variants.py`, outputs `variants_live2.txt`,
   `out_uhc_isb.txt`, `out_0jg_hprior.txt`). Rules agreed with the skeptic check: one extra observation row for the
   ellipsoid height (sigma 3 m) from the solver's OWN long-term height (`posquality.long_term`, catalog session
   middles) once a session of 5-satellite fixes exists - never from the settings home height (a map-picked home
   carries Open-Meteo terrain height, off by the -19 m geoid and the antenna height); HDOP/VDOP from the augmented
   normal matrix with the gate kept at 6; 4 satellites smoothed for "ok", 3 + prior labelled quick (they are 2x
   wider); drop the prior when the prior-free height from 5+-satellite epochs disagrees by 3 sigma for 5 min; a lone
   Galileo satellite on the GPS clock with a 1 m bias term (measured GPS-Galileo bias within 1 m; harmful without
   the prior); leave-one-out outlier check at 5 rows (the current rule needs 6 and never fires); DO-229 UDREI/GIVEI
   sigmas instead of the flat 0.3 m floor; DO-229 3-point ionosphere interpolation when one grid corner is missing
   (1.9 % of ranges fall back to Klobuchar now). **Do not** add WAAS GEO ranging (S33 has a +5-7 m bias, a model term
   is missing). Append a trailing "prior" flag to the GSPP line and update every reader of f[8] (gnss_rx ~694,
   catalog.analyze_gnss, iridium_tracker._read_live_gnss, posquality: prior-aided fixes out of the accuracy figures
   or labelled). Acceptance: own-solver R95 per session <= 5 m, session-middle spread <= 1 m, GSPP seconds /
   seconds with 4+ settled GPS (77 % before).
2. **Fallback epochs from `$CH` lines** (`spp-solver` finisher): pseudorange = c·(tow_epoch − tow_ch + coff +
   0.5·T·dop/f), L = −adr; agrees with pocket_trk's `$OBS` to 0.3 mm; a solver fed that way kept fixing through the
   8 dead hours of 11-06 (2.6x the fixes). Belt and braces now that the watchdog exists.
3. **posquality.py**: per-source correlation-time floors (own solver 240 s combined with the existing drift term,
   pocket_trk 30 s; the 120 s floor made the solver's claim optimistic and pocket_trk's 5x pessimistic); Student-t
   factor for the "all N sessions" figure (6.5x wider at N=2), show it from N >= 4, weight sessions by effective
   length. Reference points: accept a Garmin stretch only with >= 60 points at >= 0.5 points/s or scatter95 <= 5 m,
   show scatter/points/span columns, auto-star the best, say "from home (no reference starred)"; tag Garmin heights
   as barometric (they drift 12-50 m) and use them horizontally only; `refpoints.still_stretches` is O(n^2) on the
   GUI thread (1.3 s now, minutes after a day of 1 s logging) - running mean; GPX copy via .tmp + os.replace.
4. **GUI load - DONE 2026-11-07** (scripts and before/after numbers in `build\_tmp\week2\gui\`):
   - `Tracker.tick` rebuilds the live scene once per whole second (`_scene_second`); playback/scrubbing still every
     tick. Main thread busy in the GNSS map view 51 → 10 %, sky view 81 → 9 %.
   - `EphemerisOrbit.ecef()` is position-only (one Kepler solve); `sat_ecef` keeps the velocity for the solver and
     Integrity's Doppler.
   - `Data._load_captures()` re-reads only per-capture files whose (mtime, size) changed and refits only their
     satellites (load_catalog after a Stop 2.2-2.6 s → 0.02-0.13 s; results equal a full load). It calls
     catalog's private `_index_names` / `_cap_file`, and the cached capture dicts are shared between reloads - never
     mutate a capture dict in place.
   - Sky view: `HeardCells` places every heard point once into 3° az/el cells (incremental; re-placed when an
     orbit object changes, all when home moves); the plot's heard layer is a cached QPixmap; the "Up now" table
     updates only changed cells (its ResizeToContents header made each setItem ~1 ms). The 200-dots cap is gone.
     Refresh 'Everything' 187-264 → 9-15 ms; first showing places all points once (~400 ms for 783k).
   - Integrity `StripChart`: per-pixel-column min/max, one polygon per gap-free segment, two 1 px lines instead of a
     1.5 px pen (Qt's stroker was the real cost); repaint only on new points or every 10 s (tick+paint 54 → 14 ms).
   - gnss_rx: no sound tree for GNSS bands (the tracker greyed the sound controls) - **undone 2026-11-07** at the
     owner's request (the volume slider 'no longer worked'): the sound tree is back (~0.5-0.7 core); NoiseMeter and
     IQRecorder run in a `Watcher` thread fed 50 ms batches through a bounded (~1 s) queue that drops and counts,
     never blocks work(); IQRecorder fills dropped stretches with zeros so its 20 s before / 20 s after stay timed.
     gnss_rx 0.815 → 0.312 core; work() per block 0.53 → 0.17 ms. GNOISE times are batch arrival times (≤ 50 ms
     later than before). Not yet run live end to end with pocket_trk.
5. **Galileo feeding A/B** (after an hour of live data with `b_dll 0.5`): the GPS band at 2.4 MS/s (the tuner
   filters follow the rate and cut the E1B lobes at 2.048; `systems.GNSS_BAND['rate']`, +17 % pocket_trk CPU, the
   pipe and usb_latency follow `opts.rate`); `fast_acq = 1` with `el_mask = 5` (needs a fix first; re-acquisition is
   already aided; gives below-horizon skipping) together with a graceful pocket_trk exit on Stop (close the pipe,
   wait ~1 s before taskkill) so it saves `.pocket_navdata.csv`, and a per-band working folder under `data\` instead
   of `app\pocketsdr` (that file holds this antenna's position and is shared by every band and test); drop PRN 138
   and the non-transmitting Galileo PRNs from `SIGNALS`.

**Later - data and science**
6. **nav_bits.py**: decode from the `$NAV` bits pocket_trk already logs (2.1 % of lines are two records glued -
   split on `$`): GPS almanac (SF4/5) + UTC/leap (SF4 p18 second half), Galileo I/NAV words 5 (both BGDs, health),
   6 (GST-UTC), 7-10 (almanac, GGTO), SBAS MT17; a `GALM` line (handle it in the five parsing places like GGAP/GLOG),
   kept in `gnss-solver.json` under 'alm' (4 weeks); use for the "Up but not heard" list, `visible_prns`, the sky
   view's expected ring, pass prediction (labelled almanac, never drawn as "its orbit") and pocket_trk's navdata file.
   Small correctness items found: Galileo E1B uses BGD(E1,E5a) where I/NAV needs BGD(E1,E5b) (rtcm3.py 1046 branch
   discards the second field; spp.solve has a no-op `if sat[0]=='G'` branch); GPS-UTC hard-coded 18 s in gnss.py,
   gnss_rx.py, rtcm3.py; `rtcm3._full_week` has an 18-second hole before each Sunday 00:00 GPST; `fit` stored
   inverted and unread; URA/SISA and MT9 URA dropped; Galileo health packs E5b bits with E1B bits.
7. **Ephemeris archive**: keep every decoded ephemeris per satellite per toe (145 distinct over 3.4 days, ~18 kB a
   day) and pick the nearest toe per time sample, so a scrubbed time from yesterday is not drawn with today's
   ephemeris (3 km error at a day); gives an orbit history per satellite.
8. **Garmin side-by-side**: run `garmin_usb.py` as a sidecar writing `<capture>.garmin` whenever a Spanner-mode unit
   is present during a GNSS capture; catalog compares per second and per PRN (which satellites it holds that we
   drop, and from where - the direct measure of the acquisition gap; Garmin "SNR" has no relation to our C/N0); one
   panel line. The unit must be set to GPS + GLONASS with WAAS on (it was not during the review).
9. **Catalog slimming and the sky C/N0 map**: per pass keep C/N0 at 1 Hz as compact ints and Doppler every 10 s
   (87 % of the GNSS catalog is 1 Hz Doppler nobody uses; one `--redo`); a sky layer of az/el cells with median
   C/N0 from own orbits; a per-pass scintillation index; a "heard but not tracked" detector from 1 s snapshots of
   the IQRecorder ring (prototype `architecture\acq_scan.py` found G27/G10 untracked at 28-33 dB-Hz).
10. **Precise antenna position**: MSM7 decoder on rtcm3.py's bit reader + RINEX 3 writer from the kept
    `.trkN.rtcm` (caveats from the check: GPS MSM7 only while pocket_trk's PVT is valid; the lock-time indicator
    resets at every pseudorange-steering step so loss-of-lock must come from phase-vs-Doppler continuity, and the
    code-steering term must be removed as spp.py does - RTKLIB convbin on the raw file is not a shortcut; Galileo
    MSM7 is single-satellite), then RTKLIB static L1 against a CORS base or CSRS-PPP. Cheaper first step: the
    solver's static survey-in variant landed 0.69 m from home over 8.5 h (`spp-solver` outputs).
11. **Harness and code quality**: `build\tools\gnss_bench.py` (pocket_trk N times at real time on a recording with
    an optional cut/zero/spur perturbation, logs through `gnss_rx.Lines` and `spp.Solver`, one metric table - note
    `-tscale` replays starve the one-channel-at-a-time search); `build\tests\spp_replay.py` from the scratch
    `replay.py`; a 5-minute raw recording with a full navigation sync as the regression file (the 40 s file never
    reaches a position; the iq-trigger file could carry a duration); one `gnss_lines.py` parser for the six places
    that read GCH/GEPH/GPOS/GSPP/GGAP/GLOG; shared bit/time helpers (`_u/_s/_bits`, CRC-24Q, leap seconds are
    duplicated in gnss.py, spp.py, gnss_rx.py, rtcm3.py); split integrity.py's Monitor from its widgets.

**Small things noticed in week 1:** with the tracked gate (5 s at 25 dB-Hz) weak Galileo still churns TRACKING/LOST
events every 10-30 s (raise the bar for E to 30 dB-Hz or 10 s if noisy; `GNSS_TRACK_*` in iridium_tracker.py); the
GCH dedup still leaves ~7 two-second holes in 3 h (pocket_trk itself); Integrity's cn0 raise text says "blocked?"
for 3-8 s when only the satellite fingerprint (no GGAP) identifies a gap; `catalog.py --redo` is needed after any
catalog format change; the stale-text list under "Known issues" still stands.
First comparison new vs old code (same 14-minute windows, `build\_tmp\week1\compare_runs.py`): GPS acquisitions
lost within 2.5 s 38-62 % -> 0 %; GPS lock-length median 2-61 s -> 129-777 s; Galileo lock median 10 s -> 710 s
with all four Galileo satellites held and 2600+ Galileo ranges per 14 min (0-770 before); no gaps yet.

**Done after week 1 (2026-11-06 late, before week 2):**
- Galileo E1B now uses BGD(E1,E5b) (rtcm3.py 1046; spp.py's no-op branch removed) - correct per the ICD, but the
  measured effect is under 1 m (within run-to-run noise): it was never the cause of the wider fixes.
- The own solver's wider R95 on the new-code sessions is the sky, not week 1: replaying them GPS-only gives the same
  R95 6.6 m. Adding Galileo (now possible because its orbits decode) gives 19-100 % more fixes and CEP50 2.7 ->
  1.6 m but widens the worst 5 % (R95 6.6 -> 8.3-9.1 m on the 36-min 20:54 session): Galileo weighting / the lone-
  Galileo work in week 2 item 1 is where that tail gets fixed (`build\_tmp\week1b\galileo_effect.py` replays any
  session three ways).
- The 20:48 Integrity 'Satellites lost, 0 locked (was 12)' was a GUI stall (the sky-view freeze), not the gap
  fingerprint: the receiver logged all 12 every second. Integrity now judges 'locked' against the newest receiver
  line's time (`Monitor.newest_t`), not the tick's wall clock (`build\_tmp\week1b\stall_test.py` reproduces the old
  false alarm and shows it gone).
- Status bar: the position is its own label (`fix_label`, `fix_badge()` / `fix_cadence()` in iridium_tracker.py):
  green with the live fix, its satellite count, source (own solver / pocket_trk) and 'a fix every second' when a new
  fix arrives every second; amber when fixes come slower; plain home setting after 30 s without one
  (`build\_tmp\week1b\badge_test.py` replays a session through it).
- The PC clock had drifted to 2.46 s behind GPS by 20:48 (GTIME; 1.33 s at 03:56): Settings > PC clock.

## Ideas the owner wants to come back to
GNSS reflectometry snow depth (favourite); auto PPM from the GPS Doppler offset (~+0.42 ppm); precise antenna
position (hours of averaging / RTKLIB + CORS); sky C/N0 map; scintillation logging; Meteor on the map from Doppler
after a good pass; longer Garmin side-by-side runs outdoors; hydrogen line (1420 MHz) with a filtered LNA + horn.
