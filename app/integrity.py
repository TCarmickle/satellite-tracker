r"""The Integrity section: is anyone jamming or spoofing satellite navigation here? It watches the GPS L1 band
(WATCH_BANDS: GPS / Galileo / WAAS; GLONASS and BeiDou are received but not watched - a steady spur near B1I kept
alerting) and checks what it hears against physics and against itself.

Jamming (someone drowning the signals): GNSS signals arrive under the noise, so with the gain fixed the band's
power IS the noise - a jammer raises it, or shows as a peak above the band's usual shape (gnss_rx's GNOISE lines,
against a baseline learned while the band was quiet). The satellites' signal-to-noise (C/N0) falls together and
they lose lock.
Spoofing (someone sending fake satellite signals): a spoofer has to fake every satellite from one transmitter on
the ground, and that shows -
  - the position fix leaves the antenna's known location, or moves during the session
  - GPS time jumps against this PC's own clock (steps of the PC clock itself are taken out)
  - the satellites' Doppler does not match what their own broadcast orbits say it must be from here (after the
    SDR's frequency error, which is the same for all of them)
  - a satellite is heard that its own orbit puts below the horizon
  - the signals are too strong, or all the same strength (real ones differ with elevation)
Not radio at all, but it looks like it: the SDR's USB sample stream breaks for 100-140 ms a few times a day. Every
satellite drops together (C/N0 "at loss" 12-20 dB-Hz) and most are back at their previous strength within 2-15 s.
gnss_rx reports such a gap (GGAP) and pocket_trk's own log (GLOG); the fingerprint is also recognised here from the
satellites alone. A signal drop that coincides is shown as "stream gap (SDR/USB) - not RF", at most a watch, and
gets no raw-sample recording (except the first of a session, as evidence).
Each check has two levels (watch, alert); a level must hold a few seconds before it shows, and clears only after
it has been quiet a while and the value has come back below the line by a margin (no flapping on a steady spur).
Changes go to the event list (kept in integrity-events.jsonl).
Each event also gets a snapshot folder (data\integrity\<time>-<check>\): every receiver line from 2 minutes before
to 90 s after it cleared (lines.txt), event.json (the receiver's settings, the checks and satellites at the start and
end, and a summary: how long, how the noise rose and fell, what kind of signal and where in the band, each
satellite's C/N0 before and at its lowest, position and time), waterfall.png (the band over the event), and -
unless switched off - the raw samples from 20 s before to 20 s after (samples.cs8, saved by gnss_rx).

Monitor is the logic (no Qt; fed lines, asked for a report); IntegrityView is the section.
