"""GNSS receiver (GPS L1 C/A and Galileo E1B at 1575.42 MHz): streams the slice into PocketSDR's
pocket_trk, which tracks the satellites live. receiver.py starts it and saves its lines to the capture's
.live file.

  python gnss_rx.py --device ARGS --rate R --center F [--gain DB | --auto-gain] [--ppm X] [--no-dc]
                    [--start-file PATH] [--spectrum-port N] [--audio-port N] [--mode live|chunks]

GNSS signals are under the noise: they can't be seen in the spectrum, only found by correlating with each
satellite's code. pocket_trk (T. Takasu, BSD-2-Clause, in app/pocketsdr) does that, tracks the satellites,
decodes the navigation messages - including each satellite's own orbit (its ephemeris) - and computes a
position fix.
  live    (default) the samples (8-bit IQ) go through a Windows named pipe into one pocket_trk that runs
          the whole time: satellites stay locked, and its log and orbits are read as they are written, so
          the tracker hears about them within a second or two.
  chunks  the samples are written in CHUNK_S files and pocket_trk runs on each one afterwards (each chunk
          starts from scratch; results every CHUNK_S seconds). Kept as a fallback.
(pocket_trk can also drive an RTL-SDR itself through SoapySDR, but the RTL-SDR's IQ is the mirror of what
pocket_trk expects and it has no way to swap it, so the samples come from here.)
